"""She’s toying with us.""","""She’s doing a hell of a job of it, then. Almost made me shit myself.""\n\n""Julia! Neil! Anyone!"" Your walkie comes to life; it’s Strauss, her voice filled with panic.\n\nYou pull the walkie off your belt loop.\n\n""Please help us!"" Strauss cries. ""The captain keeps shooting but it’s not doin—oh god.""\n\nNeil looks at you in horror. You click the button on side the side of the talkie. You say:\n\n1.[[""Hold on, Doc. We’re coming!""]]\n2.[[""Serves you right.""]]\n3. [[Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.]]\n\n"
"Pair off with Meat.","""I'll go with Sergeant Can't Keep It In His Pants, then.""\n\n""Hey!""\n\n""We'll hike down the wall and take our respective tunnels. You guys have that one on the right over there. See it?"" she asks, pointing.\n\n""Yeah,"" Meat says. ""On it.""\n\n1. [[""This is a plan I'm not crazy about.""]]\n2.\t[[""Roger, roger.""]]"
"Wait it out.","You decide to wait it out, see if you're not infected. Too bad you killed the only guy who had access to the autopilot controls. You can't even send a distress beacon now.\n\nThat's when you notice a wetness on your cheek. You touch it with your finger and pull back blood.\n\nYou're infected. However, you can't bring yourself to eat a bullet. You've been through too much. You decide to ride it out, see what happens.\n\nNothing good. Your fingernails fall off first. Then you start vomiting and shitting blood. Your teeth are next. At this point you decide that killing yourself is the best course of action, but you go blind before you can find your gun.\n\nDays pass like this, with you lying on the floor, begging for death, unable to see anything. Finally, you feel a movement in your chest. A tremor.\n\nAnd then you feel nothing at all.\n\nThe End.\n"
"""Don't get yourself killed, doc.""","""Will try,"" she says and then takes off running, screaming her head off.\n\n""Five minutes,""  Salvucci says. ""That's all we give her.""\nMeat nods. Her footsteps (and screams) trail away. \n\nAfter three minutes, Salvucci says ""She's had enough time. Let's go.""\n\nThe three of you run down the hall to sickbay. She's inside, screwing a hose onto a black machine of some sort. She looks up. ""I told you to give me mor--""\n\nShe's interrupted by Markie's descent from the ventilation shaft onto the examination table. She growls at all of you. A giant purple claw has sprouted out of her missing arm. The other arm is rotting, like the rest of her body.\n\n""Prettyprettyprettypretty.""\n\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see the cauterizing saw on the table next to the bed. \n\n1. [[Attack with the saw.]]\n2. [[Attack with your gun.]]"
"""Don’t be a baby.""","""Easy for you to say, Julia. You’re not the one who’s being served up as dinner.""\n\nMeat slaps Neil on the shoulder. ""We won’t let you get eaten. It's gotta be you, man. You’re the tiniest one—the easiest prey, see?""\n\n""You’re not making this any more appealing.""\n\n""We can’t make him do this,"" Strauss interjects, finally saying something.\n\n""When the hell did you grow a conscience?"" Meat growls.\n\n""I did what I did for the sake of survival. There were no other options. There are other options here. We just need to think rationally.""\n\n""Well,"" Meat says. ""I’m waiting, doctor.""\n\n""No,"" Neil says. ""I’ll do it.""\n\nYou turn to Neil.\n\n1.[[""You sure?""]]\n2.[[""Atta boy.""]]\n\n"
"Run into the kitchen.","You fire several rounds as well, tearing off her other arm. Still, the body convulses. You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He’s a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body’s back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren’t far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Strauss and Meat are looking over the bloody hole in Neil’s chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil’s mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I’m so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn’t fast enough…""\n\n""Stop talking, sweetie,"" Strauss says, taking you by surprise with the earnest care in her voice as she examines the wound. ""An artery’s been pierced.""\n\n""Shit, is there anything you can do for him?""\n\nStrauss looks at you both, clearly not wanting to give her answer in front of Neil. You feel a tap on your arm. Neil looks up at you.\n\n""Zoe, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is…"" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I. Got it?""\n\n1.[[""Yeah. I understand.""]]"
"""Sleep tight, bitches.""","You slide into your chamber and the hatch closes. You quickly fall into slumber. When you wake up, you're surounded by soldiers. One of them, a corporal, is saying something but his words are soundless. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, and Meat are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nJust as Meat said, men in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, and Salvucci meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in almost complete silence, only uttering the names of the lost from time to time.\n\nYou all take seperate cabs home. When you reach your house in the suburbs, you pass your mailbox but decide to check it later. It's only when you swipe your card against the door's reader and hear it unlock that you feel as though you are truly safe. Inside, you shut the door and hang up your coat.\n\nYou go into the living room and sit on the couch. You do nothing but stare at the wall for hours, in a trance of sorts. You rub you finger up and down one of the cushions of your couch. You are alive to do this, but you're not sure you're thankful for that.\n\nYou begin to see a therapist. You make progress--according to him, anyway. You never really shake the memories of your time aboard the Speedwell, but you're able to cope with them.\n\nThat's more than can be said for Captain Salvucci, who eats a bullet on the third anniversary of your return to Mars. \n\nYou don't go to the funeral.\n\nYou and Meat stay in contact but the emails you send one another are largely bullshit. Your failure to connect with him is indicative of your relationship with the rest of humankind. You never marry or even begin what you're comfortable calling a relationship with anyone. For the first ten years or so, this bothers you but you slowly grow comfortable with this new you.\n\nYou become a writer. Your sci-fi espionage novels sell well enough for you to live comfortably by yourself and away from everyone. You're mostly happy but sometimes there's a thought strikes you like the lash of a whip.\n\nYou are alone.\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n"
"""Hang on! We're on the way.""","""Please hurry,"" she begs. ""We’re in the cockpit.""\n\n""Hustle people,"" Meat says, breaking out into a sprint.\n\nYou and Neil follow. \n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner, and his face goes pale. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci’s leg and tearing away flesh and muscle. Salvucci is against the cockpit’s door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is on the ground next to him.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n""Conserve the ammo,"" Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben’s neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate’s skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben’s youthful face glares at you. The thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He’s closing in.\n\n""Well don’t just stand there—shoot him!""\n\nYou aim down the sight of your pistol.\n\n1. [[Pull the trigger.]]"
"""Dude, stop talking.""","""Hey, fuck you. I’ve been cooped up in that room this whole time. Forgive me for being a little curious about why everything around me is going to hell.""\n\nThe three of you say nothing for the rest of the walk, but you can’t shake the feeling that Neil is angry at you.\n\nWhen you reach the sickbay, it’s deserted.\n\n""I suppose those fools are still out looking for it...or they’re dead.""\n\n""Holy shit,"" Neil says, approaching the puddle of gore in the center of the room. He stands there, gazing down at it. \n\nYou lean against the wall and take a seat, but your pistol remains in your hand. \n\n""Meat and the captain aren’t really dead, are they?""\n\n1.[[""No. Of course not.""]]\n2.[[""Who knows?""]]\n3.[[""Yeah, they’re food.""]]\n"
"Run into the kitchen!","You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He’s a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body’s back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and darts into the kitchen. You aren’t far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Meat is looking over the bloody hole in Neil’s chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil’s mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside.

Got it?""\n\n1.[[""Yes, I understand.""]]\n\n"
"""Better you than me.""","She turns away from you and leaves the mess hall. You hear her break out into a run, her footsteps echoing through the hall.\n\n""Help!"" she shrieks as she runs. ""Help!""\n\nTime passes painfully, slowly. Finally, Salvucci turns to both of you. ""We go. Now.""\n\nAll of you start running toward the hanger. ""Keep an eye out for anything,"" Salvucci says. ""It might try to use this plan against us.""\n\nYou reach the hanger in two minutes. You all peek through the threshold to see Markie advancing on a bloodied Strauss, who has her back to the hanger door. The captain's pistol lay on the floor several feet from the pair.\n\n""She's wounded,"" Meat says, defeated. ""Infected.""\n\nMarkie is shuffling closer, giggling. Strauss sees the three of you. She looks over at the panel that controls the hanger door and then looks back at you all. She nods.\n\nYou slowly raise your pistol. Markie grabs the doctor by the throat and lifts her into the air. She chokes.\n\nYou feel Meat beside you raising his rifle. His hands are shaking.\n\n1. [[End Strauss' pain.]]\n2. [[Shoot the switch.]]\n"
"Put Ryan out of his misery.","You take careful aim and fire a single shot that pierces Ryan's visor and kills him instantly. The squad vital monitor shrieks as he flatlines.\n\nThe monster roars again and then you catch a glimpse of its hideous, reptilian face as it darts out and closes its jaws around Ryan’s head. Like fingers plucking a grape from a vine, the beast rips out your squadmate’s head, leaving a bloody stump of a neck.\n\nYou flee.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but eventually you stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie. Behind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the sand. You run toward your squadmates. You’ve covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach them, Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fire several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie’s arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your empty pistol and bash the monster’s dome in. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived, as Meat puts three rounds into the soft belly.\n\n""Fucking fuck."" He kicks the crab.\n\nYou turn to Markie, who’s holding her arm. \n\n1.[[""Is your suit ripped?""]]"
"""It happened so fast.""","""Fuck it. Let’s get her aboard. We'll worry about what happened later.""\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open.  Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\n\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What’s she saying?""]]\n2.[[""What is that?""]]\n\n"
"Space it.","""Hanger it is then,"" Meat says.\n\n""One of us needs to lead it there,"" Strauss says. ""Play wounded. Beg for help. The others have to hang back otherwise it won't fall for the trick.""\n\n""I don't like this,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Me neither, but she ain't wrong,"" Meat says grimly. ""Somebody's got to be ready to put it all on the line for this.""\n\n""I'll go,"" Strauss says.\n\nMeat doesn't contain his shock. ""What?""\n\n""I think we've already established I'm helpless, which means that thing has too. It'll come running.""\n\n""This is fucking crazy. Cap, we can't send her out there. I'll go,"" Meat says.\n\n""You're the biggest of us. It won't go after you, not until it's killed everyone else off. It has to be me.""\n\nSalvucci furrows his brow. He unholsters his pistol and hands it to Strauss. ""I want my gun back, doctor. Be careful.""\n\n""Yes sir.""\n\n""Five minutes and then we're coming after you,"" Meat says.\n\nShe nods.\n\n1. [[""Be careful.""]]\n2. [[""Better you than me.""]]\n\n"
"""Nice job, shrimp. Didn't think you had it in you.""","""Thanks,"" he utters, looking away from you.\n\n""What about Markie,"" Meat asks.\n\n""We have to euthanize her,"" Strauss says, looking through the glass at Markie. ""The infection could spread.""\n\n""I thought you chopped her damn arm off so that wouldn’t happen.""\n\n""The possibility of infection still remains and, as I’m sure Zoe can attest to, officer Daniels has only worsened in the past half hour. I’d say there’s at least a fifty percent chance that what happened to the arm will happen to her.""\n\n""That thing  was bad enough, captain,"" Ben says. ""It took three rounds to kill it.""\n\n""We have no idea what kind of beast she’ll devolve into—""\n\n""If she turns in the first place. God damn it. This is a fucking human being we’re talking about.""\n\n""Keep your cool, Travis,"" Salvucci commands. \n\n""Captain, if she turns into something, I’m not sure we’ll be able to contain it. Protocol states—""\n\n""To hell with your protocol! That’s Markie we’re talking about. And you said it’s a fifty percent chance. That ain’t a sure thing. Not by a long shot.""\n\n""Do you really want to bet everyone’s lives on a single coin toss?""\n\n""Let’s just keep her in the cube until something happens, then we decide what to do with her. I’ve got my rifle. Everybody else has pistols.""\n\n""Yes, because an assault rifle worked wonders for Sergeant Benson, didn’t it?""\n\nMeat glares at Strauss but she continues.\n\n""Mark my words, if we don’t take care of that thing, it’s going to take care of us.""\n\nThe conversation is becoming heated. The captain seems uncertain what to do. You grip the pistol in your hand more tightly.\n\n1.[[""Calm your tits, everybody.""]]\n2. [[Kill Markie.]]"
"""You know what we have to do.""","He sighs. ""I know. I'll just, god..god damn it, just give me a second to set a course for the sun.""\n\nYou watch as he presses some buttons on the console and turns to you.\n\n""So, how do you want to do thi--"" he's only begun to show fear when you shoot him in the face. He flops to the floor. You carefully step past him and look out into the darkness of space.\n\nYou realize the few loved ones you have at home will never know what happened to you. You will die a mystery. You put the gun to your temple and pull the trigger.\n\nSeveral month later, the Speedwell tries to fly into the heart of the sun and is vaporized. \n\nThe End"
"""Not a damn clue.""","He sighs. ""We need to find the doctor...if she's not dead.""\n\n1.[[""Don't talk like that, cap.""]]\n2.[[""She's meat.""]]\n"
"""Why didn't you?""","""Just not worth it. They haven't come for us in two weeks. They're not going to come at all. What's the point of staying alive five days longer, y'know?""\n\nThose are the last words he says to you. He goes to sleep later and doesn't wake up. You stare at his pale body sprawled out on the floor. Your belly rumbles weakly.\n\n1. [[Resort to cannibalism.]]\n2. [[Starve.]]"
"""You okay, cap?""","""They're all dead because of me,"" he says quietly. ""I've never had people die under my command before. It's a strange feeling.""\n\n1.[[""It's not your fault.""]]\n2.[[""Move past it or more people are going to die.""]]\n"
"Get a drink with Strauss","""Thanks,"" she says quietly. You get a cab and tell him to take you to the nearest bar. There, the two of you sit in silence for at least an hour sipping your drinks. Finally, Strauss speaks.\n\n""I killed the captain. I let Ben die.""\n\n1. [[""You did.""]]\n2. [[""You only did what you had to.""]]"
"Shoot them.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n""Come on!"" Meat roars. ""This isn't a fight we can win.""\n\nYou both retreat. ""Neil,"" he yells into the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" Neil replies.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You’ve covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n""Markie,"" Meat says, ""where's Ryan?""\n\nShe stutters. ""D...d..dead.""\n\n""Fuck!"" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie. Her arm is wounded.\n\n1.[[""Are you okay?""]]\n2. [[Remain silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.]]\n"
"""I saw something.""","Before the words can leave your mouth, there’s a whooshing sound, followed by a giant spike tearing through Ryan’s chest, splattering the cave with red. Ryan’s pistol drops to the floor. He moans. \n\nYou cast your light on the protruding spike and realize, as your comrade is slowly being lifted in the air, that it’s a limb of some sort.\n\nMarkie’s voice barks over the comm. ""Julia! What’s happening? Ryan’s vitals are dropping."" You fire several shots into the darkness. One of them slaps into Ryan’s arm; his blue eyes gaze at you in shock.\n\nMeat now: ""Julia? Answer us, girl. What the fuck is going on?""\n\n1.[[""Get the Speedwell here now!""]]\n2.[[""We’ve got to go!""]]\n3.[[""Something’s got Ryan!""]] \n"
"Save Strauss.","You fire at the tentacle wrapped around Strauss' neck. The appendage snaps and she falls to the floor, gasping for breath. You run by and grab her arm, pulling her to her feet. The two of you run past the creature as it focuses its attention on Meat, who cries ""Don't leave me!""\n\nAs the two of you sprint down the hallway, you can hear his screams echo down the hallway. \n\nYou and Strauss stop when she runs out of breath.\n\n""Why did you save me?"" she asks.\n\n1.[[""Not even a simple 'thanks?'""]]\n"
"Nod at him.","He smiles. The cab pulls away and you walk past your box—you’ll get the mail later—and inside your home.\nThe door slides shut. And that’s when you fall apart. You crumble to the floor and bawl yourself to sleep. You wake hours later only to cry yourself asleep again.\n\nWhen you wake up, you want to believe it’s a new day but you can still feel the weight of the dead on your shoulders. It’s a weight you never learn to completely shake, but you grow accustomed to it all: the night terrors, the sudden flashes of Ben dying in agony.\n\nMeat’s friendship and an ungodly amount of therapy helps you get through the trauma, as does Melissa, the barista who becomes your wife. The military sticks you with an analyst position, something you’re quite fine with, though it is boring work.\n\nYou grow older. Melissa talks about having kids.\n\n1. [[Have kids.]]\n2.

Strauss demands. ""The bodies? Where are they?""\n\n""Oh good. You’re alive,"" Meat says. You can feel the force of his eyeroll from here.\n\n""Where are the bodies?

""Here’s hoping nothing eats us while we’re sleeping.""\n\nHe gets in his. You follow suit.\n\n""See you soon, lady.""\n\nYou press the button on the interior door and it slowly closes on your tube. You hear the seal clamp. A mist falls over your face.\n\nYou slowly closes your eyes and desperately hope you wake up.\n\nIt’s as though no time passes between the moment the darkness falls over you to when you open your eyes again to see ten soldiers standing over you, peering down, each of them equipped with assault rifles.\n\n""Come on, lieutenant,"" one of them says, lifting you to your feet. You see Meat being held up by two soldiers. He’s grinning like a fool.\n\n""We did it,"" his eyes say.\n\nThe troops escort you both to your own personal rooms where you’re served cheap stake and soda pop. It tastes superb. Later, you and Meat are interviewed about the incident aboard the Speedwell. You both answer the interviewer, an older man with a bald spot, as honestly as you can.\n\nAnd then he shows you security footage of you and Meat killing Strauss.\n\n""Explain,"" he says. Before you can even say anything, Meat jumps in. ""The bitch murdered the captain. She would have killed us too. You bet I fucking killed her.""\n\nAnd just like that, his confession damns you. You're both court-martialed. You both get life.\n\nYou live within the walls of Titan penitentiary for 22 more years. On the first day in prison, another woman tries to force herself on you in the showers, a shank in her hand. The guards find her later with the makeshift blade buried in her eye; her tongue has been removed and placed next to her.\n\nEventually, the other inmates come to respect you enough that you become the most powerful person in the prison. You can get almost anything you want: TVs, movies, games, gourmet food. Sometimes someone says something disrespectful; you are ruthless in dispatching them. Everyone and everything is your property.\n\nIn the twenty-second year of your reign, another upstart conspires to have you murdered. She posions a pie later brought to your cell. You die alone, reaching toward the ceiling as your insides are burned away.\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n"
"Shoot him too.","You shoot Neil as well. His corpse falls to the floor. His lifeless eyes look up at you in confusion.\n\nWhat now?\n\n1. [[End your life.]]\n2. [[Wait.]]\n"
"""I’m fine.""","He looks away sheepishly. ""Sorry.""\n\n""Stop trying to hit that, Ryan. It’s not gonna happen,"" says Markie, the Speedwell's science officer.\n\nRyan waves his hand dismissively.\n\nThe enforcer of the group, Meat, chuckles. ""She told you.""\n\n1.[[Nudge Markie and give her a wink of gratitude.]]\n"
"""We fucked things up for you. I'm sorry.""","Neil nods at you one last time. You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nStrauss follows Meat. You look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Strauss and Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. Meat grabs Strauss and pulls her through.You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. Strauss looks on sadly.\n\n1.[[""Hey! Focus. I need you here. We can stew in our guilt later, got that?""]]\n2. [[Leave him be.]]"
"You don't have kids.","You and Jack choose not to have kids. You never regret the choice, and Jack doesn't seem to either, though you do wonder what your life would be like if you had children.\n\nYou make enough money to retire. You grow old and stop shaving your legs because who gives a fuck? Jack's hair goes white first. Yours follows shortly. You decide not to get anti-aging treatments. \n\nYou wake up one morning to find your husband cold on the patio. You get down on the floor and hold his corpse for hours before you finally dial the operator and tell the poor man on the other end that your husband is dead and you have no clue what to do. He takes your address and promises he'll send an ambulance.\n\nThey come. Your heart shatters when they zip him in a bag.\n\nLater, weeks after the funeral, Meat comes to stay for a couple of weeks. He’s bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg. You watch reruns of Farscape: The Next Story and play chess. You talk of your loved ones.  Then, he brings it up: ""Do you ever think of them? The crew?""\n\n1. [[""I do.""]]\n2. [[""I don't.""]]\n3. [[""What's the point?""]]"

"""Yes, I understand.""","""Good. Give me your gun and turn the gas on before you leave.""\n\n""There’s no way out except through the front.""\n\n""Vent,"" he says, pointing at a vent near one of the stoves. ""…Gotta crawl fast. I’ll give you as much time as I can.""\n\nA clanging at the door. Whatever was inside Markie is now trying to get in the kitchen.\n\n""This ain’t fucking right, man. It’s not right at all.""\n\n""Just give me your damn gun, dude."" He coughs. Meat, with reluctance, takes the pistol from his holster and sticks it in Neil’s hand. He then goes from stove to stove, turning on the gas.\n\nAnother bang at the door. The tip of a tentacle pierces the door and writhes wildly about, slapping a nearby wall.\n\n""Go,"" Neil says, fighting to stay conscious.\n\n1.[[""I'm so sorry, Neil.""]]\n2. [[Don't say anything to him.]]\n"
"""What’s the use?""","""I dream of them from time to time,"" he says. ""I miss them."" \n\nThat’s all he says on the matter. The week passes. He leaves. His wife, Rhonda, calls you a month later to tell you he passed away in his sleep. You can’t make the funeral because traveling would make your ailing health even worse.\n\nYou wait. You spend days watching old movies. You try to make your way through a collection of Christine Love’s works, but you keep losing your focus.\n\nDeath comes when you’re sitting in your loveseat watching a news report on a bridge being built in a neighboring county. It is a quick, painful tremor that starts in your chest and spreads out.\n\nThe dark sets in. You never expected slipping away to be this easy.\n\nThe End"
"""She was infected; she killed Meat.""","""God,"" Salvucci says, holstering his weapon.\n\n""And then there were three,"" Neil says.\n\n""We're probably infected too,"" Salvucci says quietfully.\n\n""But there's been no symptoms yet.""\n\n""What if they never show up until years later? When we're back on Mars.""\n\n""Then a doctor could take care of us or something, man.""\n\nYou see Salvucci slowly reach for his pistol again. ""I can't take that risk. If our survival puts humanity in danger....""\n\n""Cap,"" Neil says, backing into the wall. ""Think straight here.""\n\n""I'm sorry, Neil. I'm sure Julia agrees.""\n\n1. [[Die.]]\n2. [[Don't die yet.]]\n"
"Go eat something.","The mess hall is rather small: two tables next to an enclosed kitchen. You find Meat sitting at by himself, shoveling ramen into his mouth. A plastic cup filled with cheap whiskey is next to his arm. You grab your favorite snack, baked potato chips, and take a seat.\n\nMeat looks up at you, eyes red, a weary expression.\n\n""Hell of a day, huh? Poor Ryan. How's Markie? How are you?""\n\n1.[[""Strauss is taking her freakin' arm off.""]]\n2.[[""Cut the shit. You know how my day's been.""]]\n\n"
"Improvise.","Without a word to your companions, you dash across the room and grab the hose. The freezing gas pours over your pants and chest. The cold nearly makes you drop the hose--it's like you've fallen into freezing water.\n\nMarkie makes a beeline for you. You lock eyes with Salvucci. Luckily, he understands and raises his pistol.\n\nYou brace yourself as Markie slams into you. Both of you fall to the ground, the hose pointed upward into the chest of the creature. The monster unleashes a hellish scream as you push up as hard as you can. The hose hisses. \n\nYou hear Meat yell something. And then a loud pop. A weight is lifted off your chest as Markie falls to the right, but you know not to let up: you aim the hose to the right. Through the mist, you see her flailing about.\n\nSomething grabs you and forces you to let go of the hose. It drags you away to the corner of the room. You feel cold inside. Every breath hurts...and your hand feels lighter. \n\nThrough blurred vision, you watch as Salvucci approaches Markie, each footsteep dispelling the mist, and points his sidearm down at her face. He fires, shattering her hideous, frozen visage.\n\nYou did it: she's dead.\n\n""Captain!"" Meat yells, he's looking down at you, eyes filled with panic. ""Get over here.""\n\nSleep takes you.\n\n1. [[Awaken.]]\n\n"
"""I don't think so, Meat.""","He sighs. ""I want to believe you, but...nevermind. What now?""\n\n1.[[""We sleep.""]]\n\n"
"Look into her eyes as she dies.","You stare into her eyes as the life is choked out of her by your companion. She reaches for you helplessly but then her arm goes limp.\n\n""Dude, stop!"" Neil yells, but Meat doesn't. A minute later, Strauss has stopped moving altogether. The light's gone out of her eyes. Meat lets her corpse drop to the floor. \n\nNeil moans in horror. ""Travis...""\n\n""She would have killed us, man; the moment she saw any of us as a threat, she would have killed as without a thought, just to save her sorry hide. Good riddance.""\n\nMeat lights up his molotov and throws it atop Ben and the captain's corpses.\n\n""So, uh, what do we do now?"" Neil asks after a long bout of silence.\n\n""We're not done hunting, Neil.""\n\n""With what? You saw what bullets did to Ben: took a whole damn clip and then some.""\n\n""We'll have to improvise, won't we? I don't know about you, but I sure as fuck don't plan on being some monster's dinner.""\n\n1.[[""We need to draw it out into the open.""]]\n\n\n"
"""Cut the shit. You know how my day's been.""","He sighs. ""Figured as much.""\n\nThe PA clicks on: ""All officers report to sickbay,"" Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his food and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you’re out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nThe door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube. She’s looking around wildly.\n\nYou smell gunsmoke. Ben has both of his hands wrapped around his pistol.\n\n1.[[""Why weren't we invited to the party?""]]\n2.[[""Something happened, huh?""]]"
"""Guess we should go investigate, eh?""","""Fuck that!"" Meat says, turning. He aims his assault rifle at the first speaker and dismembers it with a single shot. He takes the second and third speakers out of commission as well. The music is no longer overpowering, but you can hear its echoes in the hallway.\n\n""Brutal, but effective,"" Strauss comments.\n\nSalvucci frowns. ""You’re footing the bill for that when we get back.""\n\n""Guys, now that Zoe is awake, I think we should talk strategy. I just finished with our travel projections…"" Neil says.\n\n""And?"" Strauss says, as though she knows what’s coming next.\n\n""Well, it’s like you said, doc: not good. Two months to Mars.""\n\n""We could last that long,"" Salvucci says. ""We ration food, ammo, go in groups to the rest of the ship when we need supplies.""\n\n""Captain, permission to speak?"" Meat says.\n\nSalvucci nods.\n\n""That’s a horrible idea. We’ve got guns. Why don’t we use them? For all we know, that beastie thing could be growing. We need to hunt it down and kill it now.""\n\n""Travis, I put a gun against Markie’s head and blew her brains all over the floor. Apparently the thing inside her shook it off and walked away. I don’t think bullets are going to save us.""\n\n""Then we destroy the body completely,"" Meat suggests. ""Shoot it, stomp it, burn it, and then jettison the motherfucker into space.""\n\n""Captain, I don’t like either choice, but I think the more cautious one would be eliminating its presence from the ship,"" Strauss says slowly.\n\n""Didn’t you say something about it being airborne?"" Salvucci asks. ""Could killing it infect one of us?""\n\nStrauss sighs, shrugs. ""There’s no way to be sure. I didn’t get to run any tests on it. However, I’d rather take a chance on that possibility than risk us starving ourselves into easy prey.""\n\nSilence fills the common room. Then—\n\n""What do you think, Zoe?"" Neil asks.\n\nEveryone turns to you.\n\n1.[[""Let's go kill it.""]]\n2.[[""We should wait it out.""]]\n\n"
"""Man up already!""","""Easy for you to say, Zoe. You’re not the one who’s being served up as dinner.""\n\nMeat slaps Neil on the shoulder. ""We won’t let you get eaten, okay?""\n\n""You’re not making this any more appealing.""\n\nHe takes a breath. ""Okay, well, how are we going to do this?""\n""We’ll go to the cafeteria--big, open space.""\n\nYou all make your way to the cafeteria, eyes watching the walls and vents. The journey is a safe one. \n\nAll of you step into the cafeteria.\n\nNeil looks out across the tables like a man looking at his own grave.\n\n""I always thought lunchrooms were kind of scary when I was a kids, ‘cause of the bullies and all. Never thought I’d die in one, though.""\n\n""You’ll be fine,"" Meat says. ""We’ll be in the other room. You’re gonna stay in here and use your walkie.""\n\n""To do what?""\n\n""Be bait. Make helpless noises.""\n\n""How’s it gonna hear that?""\n\n""Marki—what used to be Markie has a walkie clipped to her belt.""\n\n""And if she thinks it’s a trap?""\n\n""She won't, okay?"" Meat says as you and he make your way to the kitchen door.\n\n""I can’t believe this shit.""\n\nYou and Meat step into the kitchen and move away from the door. He turns to you. ""Make sure you have your gun ready, okay? I don’t want Neil to get eaten because we ran dry.""\n\nYou check your pistol to make sure it has a full clip and nod.\n\nYou both silently and listen to Neil in the other room. ""Please help me,"" you hear him beg. ""I can’t find you guys.""\nThis goes on for 20 whole minutes, Neil’s acting growing steadily worse. ""I fucking hurt my leg,"" he whimpers.\n\n""He's clearly never taken a drama class,"" Meat says.\n\n""Oh fuck,"" Neil says urgently. \n\n1. [[Give Meat the walkie.]]\n"
"""Happy thoughts, Meat. Happy thoughts.""","""Damn. Do you hear that?""\n\nFootsteps. Giant footsteps.\n\n""Let's go.""\n\nYou both retreat to the hanger.\n\n""Shit,"" he says as the door slides shut behind you. ""I thought this thing was bigger.""\n\nHe’s right: it’s not much, and half the room is cramped by the reconnaissance droids.\n\n""Loosen the holding clamps on those. I’ll get our suits. Hurry, it can’t be far behind us.""\n\nYou deactivate the locks on the droids and catch the suit that Meat throws you. You’re just about to put the helmet on when you hear the clanging on the door.\n\n""Shit. It’s here. When it gets in front of the droids, shoot the hanger switch, okay? And for fuck’s sake, hold on to something.""\n\n1.\t[[""Stay safe.""]]\n"
"Look at your foot.","The sight of the bandaged nub makes you sick.\n\n""Told you not to look at it.""\n\nHe wheels you down to the cryo room where Neil and Salvucci are waiting.\n\n""There's captain kickass herself!"" the pilot says. ""Oh don't look so put out, I'll buy you a foam finger when we get back to Mars.""\n\n1.[[""Fuck. You.""]]\n2. [[Laugh.]]\n"

"""Not much to eat.""","He gives a weak laugh. ""Can't argue with that."" He looks out across the hall to the viewport where stars, endless and bright, can be seen.\n\n""I really wish things hadn't turned out this way,"" he says.\n\nThose are the last words he says to you. He goes to sleep later and doesn't wake up. You stare at his pale body sprawled out on the floor. Your belly rumbles weakly.\n\n1. [[Resort to cannibalism.]]\n2. [[Starve.]]\n\n\n"
"""Open the door, numbnuts.""","Before you can answer, Strauss slams the fist of her unwounded arm against the door.\n\n""Listen here, you little shit. You open this door right now or so help me I’ll put you to sleep, slather whatever honey we have left in the cafeteria on your testicles, and we’ll use you as bait for the fucking monster.""\n\nThe door slides open. Neil’s face, boyish as ever, awaits you and Strauss. He is unharmed.\n\n""It eats honey?""\n\n""I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fathom the depths of your stupidity, pilot.""\n\nNeil frowns; he seems genuinely hurt by the remark.\n\n1.[[""Come on.

"""No. Nothing at all.""","You snatch the gun from his holster and shoot him in the shin. He falls to the ground screaming in pain.\n\n""The fuck, Zoe?!""\n\nYou back away from him, pistol aimed at his head.\n\n1.[[""Come after me and I'll vent your head.""]]\n2. [[Say nothing and leave.]]"
"""Something over there.""","Before the words can leave your mouth, there’s a whooshing sound, followed by a giant spike tearing through Ryan’s chest, splattering the cave with red.

Strauss asks.\n\n""He never leaves the cockpit.""\n\n""Do you really want to risk his life on that confidence?""\n\n""Since when did you start to care so much about people who wer--""\n\n""Don't finish that sentence, Travis.""\n\n1.

"""You alright?""","""Dead. He's dead,"" she says again.\n\nAbove you you hear the road of the Speedwell's thruster as the ship lands. The sound frightens the fungal crabs back into their home.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open.  \n\nInside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you—-his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. She's delerious now, stumbling. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""I dunno. I think the blood on Markie's suit isn't all hers, though.""\n\n""Damn it, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  \n\nYou glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1. [[""What the hell is she saying?""]]"
"""Yes, Ryan, I’m fine.""","He looks away sheepishly. ""Sorry.""\n\n""Stop trying to hit that, Ryan. It’s not gonna happen,"" says Markie, the Speedwell's science officer.\n\nRyan waves his hand dismissively.\n\nThe enforcer of the group, Meat, chuckles. ""She told you.""\n\n1. [[Nudge Markie and give her a wink of gratitude.]]\n"
"""We're still breathing.""","""Yeah, that’s what counts, I guess. What now?""\n\n1.[[""We sleep.""]]"
"Thank her for taking care of you.","""No problem, sweetie,"" she says, smiling. She leaves and you never see her again.\n\nMeat is the one who picks you up from the hospital and drives you home.\n\n""Those are pretty badass,"" he says, nodding toward your augmented hand. ""Can you, like, crush steel and shit?""\n\n1.[[""I wish!""]]"
"Don't have kids.","You and Melissa choose not to have kids. Well, actually, you're the one who chooses not to and she never makes too much of a fuss about it, though you think she resents you for it.\n\nYou make enough money to retire. You grow old and stop shaving your legs, because who gives a fuck? Melissa’s hair goes white first. Yours follows shortly. You decide not to get anti-aging treatments. \n\nYou wake up one morning to find your wife cold on the kitchen floor. You get down on the floor and hold her corpse for hours before you finally call the operator and tell the poor man on the other end that your wife is dead and you have no clue what to do. He takes your address and promises he'll send an ambulance.\n\nThey come. Your heart shatters when they zip her up in a bag.\n\nLater, weeks after the funeral, Meat comes to stay for a couple of weeks. He’s bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg. You watch reruns of Friends 2041 and play chess. You talk of your loved ones and his children. Then, he brings it up: ""Do you ever think of them? The crew?""\n\n1.[[""Yes.""]]\n2.[[""Never.""]]\n3.[[""What’s the use?""]]\n\n"
"""Holes?""","""Yes, that's what I said,"" he says without turning to look at you. ""Don't worry though. I'll have it patched up in a jiffy, and then I'll send you back.""\n\n1.[[""To die among the stars? No thanks.""]]"
"""Screaming isn't going to get us anywhere.""","""You're right. Let's, uh, let's go to the cockpit. Set a course for Mars.""\n\nYou follow Neil to the cockpit. Halfway there he stumbles and nearly falls. ""I'm okay!"" he says. ""I'm okay.""\n\nIn the cockpit, Neil nearly trips when he gets to the console, curses; he turns to you and his face goes pale.\n\n""You're bleeding...from your eyes.""\n\nYou feel the wetness on your cheek. You put a finger to the wetness and come away with a red smattering. You look at Neil and see that he's bleeding from his nose. After a second, he notices too.\n\n""I guess we're both infected now. Shit.""\n\n1.[[""You know what we have to do.""]]\n\n"
"Approve.","You and the bride-to-be get along well. She proves to be invaluable emotional support after Melissa dies from a stroke.\n\nShortly after the funeral, Meat comes to visit and stays a couple of weeks.\n\nHe’s bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg.

"""I guess that means you’re useless in a fight.""","""Yes,"" she says. ""I guess it does, doesn't it?""\n\nThe two of you proceed down the main hallway.

"""Whatever.""","Strauss is waiting for you when you step outside. She’s holding her arm. There’s a patch of red coming through the white sleeve right above her elbow.\n\n""It’s not a bite,"" she says, noticing your stare. ""I fell when I was running and my arm took the fall.""\n\n1.[[""Oh good, that means your ass is useless in a fight.""]]\n2.[[""Don't strain yourself; I don't want to be scooping you off the ground while I'm trying to shoot something.""]]"
"""That's bullshit and you know it.""","""Yeah,"" he says, not meeting your eyes. ""Whatever. We need...we need to get this boat moving again. He gave you a password, right? Let's hope that console has autopilot or some shit. Worry about that motherfucker then.""\n\nThe two of you make your way toward the cockpit.\n\nA few minutes later you reach the cockpit door. Ben’s body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n""Well, that’s good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You step into the cockpit. The door slides shut behind you.\n\n""Here’s the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you. You type in ""KONAMI.""\n\nThe screen changes to a selection of menus.\n\n""Here we go: autopilot"" says Meat. He touches the screen and selects NEW AUSTIN. You head for the door.\n\n""All right, good. We're set. Let's get the hell out of her--""\nA tentacle sweeps through the door as soon as it opens and brushes both of you aside with a mighty swing. \n\nYou slam into the viewport, cracking the glass, and then fall to the floor. Looking up, you see the thing step into view: it’s monstrous, with a muscular human abdomen. The thing’s face is distinctly unhuman with countless, slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster’s mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattle snake.\n\nYou turn to look at Meat. He's being lifted into the air by one of the tentacles. His face turns red; he's slowly being choked to death.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Save Meat's life.]]\n2. [[Save yourself; leave him to die.]]"
"""What is it, Travis?""","""There's no way to say this. Just, uh, move your right hand from beneath the sheet if you can.""\n\nYou do. What you see makes you sick to your stomach, causes dread to twist around your spine. The pinky and ring finger on your right hand are gone. A bandaged partial cast covers where they used to be. Even with the cast over the area, you can tell they're gone.\n\n""You lost one of your feet, too.""\n\n1.[[""The whole foot?""]]\n2.[[""God damn it.""]]"
"""Uh...""","""It doesn’t work like that, Ryan. I’m reading at least five tunnels, carved out exactly the same size.""\n\n""Meaning what?""\n\n""There might be something down there.""\n\n""Spooky,"" Meat says, peering through the scope of his rifle at the expanse of the crater.\n\n1.[[""We should check it out.""]]\n2.[[""Yeah, no, fuck that.""]]\n3. [[Wait in silence.]]"
"""Good, all things considered.""","""That makes one of us, at least. Level with me though. You think we got a chance against this thing?

"Fire the gun.","You squeeze the trigger twice. Each round hits, but it doesn’t even faze him. Ben opens his mouth and a moan leaks out. Almost all of his teeth are gone. This close, you can see that the iris of his remaining eye is yellow. You take aim again.\n\nSalvucci, standing on his wounded leg, beats you and Meat to the trigger.\n\nThe captain grabs Ben by the side of his face and throws him into the wall. The thing moans as it hits the floor. It’s surprisingly quick to rise, but Salvucci already has the crowbar in his hand.\n\nHe grunts and brings the curved end down on the back of Ben’s head hard. The monster crumbles and is hit again as it slowly lifts its head. Red and yellow matter splatter the wall—little squirts at first, but they grow larger once the back of the skull caves in.\n\nSalvucci drops the crowbar and falls back onto the floor, out of breath.\n\nMeat approaches the beast. It slowly sticks its hand out toward him, fingers crawling across the floor like a wounded spider. Meat raises his boot above the monster’s head and stomps. Once. Twice. \n\nBen convulses. He goes still after the third impact. Meat steps past the body and helps Salvucci to his feet.\n\n""Cap..."" Neil says, looking at the leg wound. \n\n""I’ll brush it off,"" Salvucci says, limping to the door. He bangs his fist against it twice.\n\n""Doctor, it’s the captain. Everything is safe out here. Open up.""\n\nThe door slides open. Strauss steps out and, seeing Ben’s corpse, puts her hand over her mouth to cover a gasp. You see her eyes water. She quickly turns her attention to Salvucci.\n\n""No worse for wear,"" he says looking at the hole beneath his knee. She backs away from Salvucci. ""No,"" she utters, ""no.""\n\n""We have to take that leg off now, ""Meat says.\n\n""You know that’s not going to do any good,"" Strauss fires back.\n\n""Are you just a fucking heartless bitch or what?!"" Meat yells.\n\n""Travis, it’s all right."" Salvucci’s expression is one of weary acceptance.\n\n""We both know what this bite means.""\n\n""There has got to be another way, captain.""\n\n""Yeah, yeah,"" Neil says. ""We can put you in cryosleep or something.""\n\n""Even if it wasn’t for the infection, this wound means I’m dead weight. You need to cut me lose. Burn what’s left.""\n\n""No,"" Meat says firmly. He shakes his head defiantly. ""We’re not doing that.""\n\n""That’s an order, Travis.""\n\n""I fucking said no!""\n\nYou barely have time to register that Strauss has taken the gun from your holster before the shot rings out. A brief spray of red. The captain falls like a tree. Blood gushes from his head. His lifeless green eyes stare at the ceiling.\n\nA moment of silence passes as everyone stares at the body. Strauss drops your gun to the floor, and everyone turns to her.\n\n1.[[""You psychotic, pathetic piece of shit.""]]\n2.[[Punch her.]]\n"
"""Don't be such a bitch, Strauss.""","Strauss narrows her eyes at you. ""He should realize the gravity of the situation and man the fuck up.""\n\n""Well maybe I'd understand the aforementioned gravity if someone would tell me what the hell was going on.""\n\n1.[[""Ben's dead too.""]]\n"
"""What the hell did you do?""","""I found out what the first symptom is. It's fear. I could feel the disease incubating in my body.

I was going to go back and do the same to you, and then to the others, but, well, what's the point? We're all gonna die in the end anyway,"" she says, sobbing. ""God, we're all going to die. Slowly. Bleeding out of our orifices. I did Travis a favor really."" She looks you directly in the eyes.\n\n""Please kill me. I don't want to die like Markie did. Please.""\n\nShe nods at your pistol.\n\n1.

"""Who knows?""","""That's comforting.""\n\nHe turns to Strauss.

Well, okay, so what should we do to pass the time?""\n\n""Time’s going to pass regardless of what we do with it.""\n\n""Right. So you’re going to sulk over there in the corner.

"Let someone else ask.","""We're waiting,"" Meat says.\n\n""There are tunnels.""\n\nRyan turns. ""Come again?""\n\n""Tunnels. In the crater.

"""What’s up with you and Meat?""","""He's an idiot. I'm not. End of story."" \n\nThe rest of the journey is conducted in silence.\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit.

"Simply nod.","When you get inside your house, you finally allow yourself to break down and cry. For the dead, for you, for Strauss.\n\nIt takes years for you to come to terms with the fact that you're alive. You see a therapist to help you cope with the nightmares and PTSD episodes. You are reassigned to a boring job as an analyst, an occupation you're fine with. You never marry, though you do have a series of healthy relationships with their ups and downs.\n\nTwenty years later, Strauss sends you an email out of the blue; ""I'm sorry"" is all it says. The next morning the local news reports the suicide of a renowned doctor. You turn off the TV before the anchor says her name. Though you never really talked after the Speedwell incident, you can't help but feel that your universe is a little smaller without Lenore Strauss in it.\n\nYou are now alone.\n\nThe End\n"
"""Of course. We just need to flush it out and kill it…somehow.""","""Yeah, I guess I should focus some of my mental energy on figuring out how to kill it instead of wasting it on fucking checkers, huh?""\n\n""Make your move already, dude,"" says Neil, growing impatient.\n\n""Fine.

"Go to sickbay.","The lights are off in sickbay. As you step inside a rotten smell hits you in the face. It takes all your strength not to lean over and barf.\n\n""What the hell is that?"" Meat says.\n\n""Doctor Strauss? Ben?"" Salvucci calls.\n\nThe three of you inch forward. Meat turns on the flashlight attached to his rifle. There’s a giant blood smear on the wall. He gently moves the rifle around, illuminating different areas of the room.\n\n""What do you think happened?"" Meat asks.\n\nBefore you can answer, you step on something. Something squishy. Meat shines his light on it.\n\n1. [[Look down]]\n"
"""Yeah, yeah, get on with it.""","Meat smiles and closes the pod. A moment exists between when the gas floods your chamber  and when you wake up in a hospital bed on an army base in New Texas. A brief, dark moment.\n\n""Hello, Julia,"" your doctor says with a friendly smile. ""We took the liberty of installing your augmentations while you were under a delayed cryo release,"" she says. She has pretty eyes, and she's blonde. You were always a sucker for blondes.\n\nSome suits come by a day later and ask you for your official account of what happened aboard the Speedwell. You tell them everything, although you feel like a bit of a loony. They thank you for your time and leave you to rest.\n\nLess than a week later, you're released from the care unit.

"""Sleep well.""","You slide into your chamber and the hatch closes. You quickly fall into slumber. When you wake up, you're surounded by soldiers. One of them, a corporal, is saying something but his words are soundless. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, and Meat are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nJust as Meat said, men in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, and Salvucci meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in almost complete silence, only uttering the names of the lost from time to time.\n\nYou all take seperate cabs home. When you reach your house in the suburbs, you pass your mailbox but decide to check it later. It's only when you swipe your card against the door's reader and hear it unlock that you feel as though you are truly safe. Inside, you shut the door and hang up your coat.\n\nYou go into the living room and sit on the couch. You do nothing but stare at the wall for hours, in a trance of sorts. You rub you finger up and down one of the cushions of your couch. You are alive to do this, but you're not sure you're thankful for that.\n\nYou begin to see a therapist. You make progress--according to him, anyway. You never really shake the memories of your time aboard the Speedwell, but you're able to cope with them.\n\nThat's more than can be said for Captain Salvucci, who eats a bullet on the third anniversary of your return to Mars. You don't go to the funeral.\n\nYou and Meat stay in contact but the emails you send one another are largely going through the motions bullshit. You never send a word to one another that is true. Your failure to connect with him is indicative of your relationship with the rest of humankind. You never marry or even begin what you're comfortable calling a relationship with anyone. For the first ten years or so, this bothers you but you slowly grow comfortable with this new you.\n\nYou become a writer. Your sci-fi erotica, written under a pseudonym, sells well enough for you to live comfortably by yourself and away from everyone.

"Shoot the monster.","You fire your last shot in the dark. The beast roars again and then you catch a glimpse of the monster’s hideous, reptilian face as it darts out and closes its jaws around Ryan’s head. \n\nLike fingers plucking a grape from a vine, the beast rips out your squadmate’s head, leaving a bloody stump. The squad vital monitor shrieks at you, and you flee. \n\nLooking over your shoulder, you watch as what’s left of Ryan is pulled out of sight.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you eventually stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie. Behind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the dirt. You run toward your squadmates. You’ve covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell descending.\n\nWhen you reach them Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fires several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie’s arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your empty pistol and bash the monster’s dome inward. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived, as Meat puts three rounds into the soft underbelly.\n\n""Fucking fuck."" He kicks the crab.\n\nYou turn to Markie, who’s holding her arm. \n\n1.[[""Your suit's ripped.""]]"
"Answer Neil.","""She’s fucking here, guys. She reeks.""\n\n""Sit tight,"" Meat says. He nods at you. Both of you creep to the door. Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with perspiration. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that’s not what’s making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n""Stay away from me,"" Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n""Now,"" Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn’t even have time to turn her head before rifle fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You’re not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you. Luckily, there’s not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n""Oh godfuckingshit,"" Neil yells. ""That was Markie.""\n\nStrauss emerges from the kitchen, a napkin over her mouth and nose. She takes one glance and then looks away.\n\n""So, we like win now, right? They’re all dead?""\n\n""Yeah, I think—""\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie’s hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump.

"Barracks","""All right, let's head that way,"" the captain says. The four of you make your way to the barracks. Inside, you see two rows of bunkbeds and all your personal belongings.
