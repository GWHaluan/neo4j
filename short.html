Well, misery, company and all that, I suppose.”\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit. You knock on the door.\nNeil’s muffled voice comes from beyond the door: “Password?”\n\n1.\t[[“Uhh…”]]\n2.\t[[“42.”]]\n3.\t[[“Open the damn door.”]]\n</div>

I mean, sure, these tunnels are uh pretty deep, I guess, but erosion can do that, right? Erosion. Yeah.”\n\nYou continue on, the darkness before you disappearing to reveal only more darkness. Your suit tells you that ten minutes have passed, but it feels like an age. Ryan’s chatter isn’t helping.\n\n“Hey, has Markie talked you about me at all?
