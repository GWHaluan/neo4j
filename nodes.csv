"Say nothing at all.","Markie sighs. The four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss. The area of impact stretches for miles.\n\n"""I don’t even see a fucking twig, man,""" Meat says.\n\n"""It’s been over a hundred years since the impact. I think all you’re going find is dirt down there,""" Markie replies.\n\n"""Don’t forget the radiation,""" Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n"""That too."""\n\nMarkie peers down. """Zoom,""" she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n"""You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?""" Ryan asks Meat. """I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y’ know? Girls go for that sort of thing."""\n\nMeat grunts. """Not my woman. She’s endowed, but it ain’t with brains. The humor would, uh, escape her."""\n\n"""And the radiation,""" Markie points out.\n\n"""Stupid radiation. Ruining everything,""" Ryan says.\n\n"""Hmm. That’s interesting,""" Markie says—it’s almost a whisper.\n\n1. [["""Well, out with it Mark. What is it?"""]]\n2.[[Let someone else ask.]]\n"
"Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.","Meat takes the walkie from you. """Doc,""" he says.\n\n"""Please hurry,""" she begs. """We’re in the cockpit."""\n\n"""Hustle people,""" Meat says, breaking out into a sprint. \n\nYou and Neil follow. \n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci’s leg and tearing away flesh and muscle.  Salvucci is against the cockpit’s door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is next to his body.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n"""Conserve the ammo,""" Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben’s neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate’s skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben’s youthful face glares at you.\n\nThe thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He’s closing in.\n\n"""Well don’t just stand there—shoot him!"""\n\nYou aim down the sight.\n\n1.\t[[Fire the gun.]]\n"
"Remain silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.","Above you you hear the roar of the Speedwell's thruster as the ship lands. The sound frightens the fungal crabs back into their home.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open.  Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\n\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n"""Get her to sickbay."""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship.

Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she looks around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n"""And I was young and we were running,""" Markie rambles, """eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish."""\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[["""What’s she saying?"""]]\n2.[["""What is that?"""]]"

Neil takes one of Meat’s checkers.\n\nThey look up at you.\n\n"""Thought we’d see a lot of boring shit on this trip, didn’t expect to run into a fucking alien,""" Meat says.\n\n"""Is it an alien, though? I mean, maybe it’s just something that’s been in the Earth the entire time?"""\n\n"""Shut up, Neil.

"Pick up the walkie","You pick up the walkie. Meat takes it.  """Neil, are you okay?"""\n\n"""She’s fucking here, guys. Oh Jesus, she reeks."""\n\n"""Sit tight,""" Meat says. He nods at you. Both of you creep to the door. Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with perspiration. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that’s not what’s making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n"""Stay away from me,""" Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n"""Now,""" Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn’t even have time to turn her head before machinegun fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You’re not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you.  Luckily, there’s not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n"""Oh godfuckingshit,""" Neil yells. """That was Markie."""\n\nStrauss emerges from the kitchen, a napkin over her mouth and nose. She takes one glance and then looks away.\n\n"""So, we like win now, right? They’re all dead?"""\n\n"""Yeah, I think—"""\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie’s hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump. He fires the rest of the clip into the corpse.\n\n1. [[Shoot.]]\n2. [[Run.]]\n\n"
"""Let's go see Neil.""","Salvucci nods. """That’s a good idea.  You take doctor Strauss and do that. Travis and I will go check engineering. If it's wounded and looking for some place to hide, there’s plenty of spots. Let’s meet back here in an hour."""\n\nStrauss scoffs. """You’re treating the beast like it's a wounded animal limping toward its doom. You’re wrong. It showed no hesitation when it attacked. It’s not afraid of us. It’s waiting."""\n\nSalvucci wrinkles his nose as he is wont to do when someone says something that annoys him. """Regardless, we’ll find the creature and put it down."""\n\n"""Creatures,""" she says, correcting him. """There might be two of them now."""\n\n"""Noted,""" Meat says, replacing the clip in his rifle. You realize now that he has the most powerful firearm on the ship.\n"""If you two run into it or them or whatever, don’t try to fight. Just run. Come find us."""\n\n"""We should stop talking and get on our way,""" Strauss says gruffly. """Before it eats that damnable pilot, which wouldn’t be such a bad thing if we didn’t need him to fly the ship."""\n\n"""Now’s not the time for jokes, Doctor,""" Salvucci says.\n\n"""Who says I was joking?"""

"Finish programming the pods.","Strauss shows up just as you finish. She smells like smoke.\n\n"""It's done."""\n\nShe takes off her glasses and places them on a table nearby.\n\nShe looks at you, tears in her eyes, and says """I just want to sleep."""\n\nShe gets into her pod without another word. The hatch closes over her. You get in yours and close your eyes as the hatch seals. Sleep follows.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod. \n\nBoth you and Strauss are transported to private rooms on the biggest military outpost in New Austin. You order steak and wine but find that you don't have an appetite. Some suits interview you and, after you answer every question, you're told that you'll be allowed to leave soon.\n\n"""Soon""" turns out to be three days. You and Strauss meet on the base. She seems paler and thinner.\n\n"""Can we get a drink?""" she asks. """I just want to go somewhere, anywhere but home first."""\n\n1.[["""Sure, why not?"""]]\n2. [[Go on home.]]"
"""I'm alive.""",""""A keen observerer, you are.""" His voice is twangy. Maybe you're on Mars somehow.\n\n"""No,""" he says. """You're not on Mars.

"We need to draw it out.",""""Okay, with what?""" Neil asks.\n\nThere’s a moment of silence as you, Meat, and Strauss turn to look at Neil. \n\n"""Oh,""" he says, getting it. """Well fuck that."""\n\n1. [["""Don’t be a baby."""]]\n2. [["""We could just knock you out."""]]\n\n\n"
"""Are you two serious? This is insane!""",""""I already took one risk today, Zoe, and that got someone else killed. Superstitious or not, we’re doing this.

"""Home. Let's get the fuck home.""",""""Yeah, let’s."""\n\nThe two of you walk back through the hallway leading to the hanger and then to the cockpit.

"""That's better. Now, any idea on how we kill this thing?""",""""One, but we have to act quickly. Let's go to sickbay."""\n\nYou follow her.

She ejects each bullet from the clip and then sticks her brush carefully inside the flask. Pulling the brush from the flask, she coats each bullet with some of the goo.\n\n1.[["""Explanation please."""]]"
"""So if we can't melt it...what's the point?""",""""I'm getting there. The viewport windows are bulletproof, but enough acid might penetrate all the layers. All it takes is one crack on the outside layer."""\n\n1. [["""We're gonna blow him into space?"""]]"

"Blast 'em.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n"""Come on!""" Meat roars. """This isn't a fight we can win."""\n\nYou both retreat. """Neil,""" he yells into the comm. """Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here."""\n\n"""Coming as fast I can,""" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feelings in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You’ve covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n"""Markie,""" Meat says, """where's Ryan?"""\n\nShe stutters. """D...d..dead."""\n\n"""Fuck!""" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie.

"Shoot Ben.","You go for your gun, but someone beats you to the trigger. A shot tears off Ben's lower jaw, sending it flying into the wall. The second splits his forehead. The body falls back onto the floor and continues to gurgle.\n\nYou turn to see Strauss holding up the captain's pistol, tears in her eyes.\n\n"""Doc,""" Meat says, but she walks past him and continues to fire round after round into the corpse. Ben goes silent and still.\n\n"""Lenore,""" Salvucci says, reaching out to comfort her. \n\n"""We have to burn him too,""" she says, no hint of emotion in her voice. """Don't touch him. Don't want to risk infection anymore than we possibly have."""\n\n"""What about airborne infection?""" Salvucci asks.\n\n"""What of it?""" she says. """If it's airborne, we're dead anyway."""\n\n"""I'll go get some oil then,""" say Meat.\n\n"""And I'll check on the console in the cockpit and hope to god Neil had enough time or selflessness to set up our autopilot.

Meat, in a moment of calculated rage, lifts his foot high over Ben's skull and stomps it several times. The insides of the boy's head ooze out like the innards of an old tomato. After he's done with Ben, he steps over to Strauss' body and aims his rifle down at her head.\n\nHe looks at the captain, who nods.

On the Head-Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. You see that yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\nYou proceed through the cave.\n\n"""You know what I want?""" Meat asks. He doesn't wait for you to answer. """I want a fucking taco. Beef. Cheese. Some guac on top. No more of this space bag food bullshit."""\n\n1.[["""Pizza."""]]\n2.[["""Space food's not so bad."""]]"
"""We need to go. Now!""",""""Meet us at the center of the crater!""" Markie yells over the comm.\n\nYou look at Ryan’s heart monitor: he’s about to flatline.\n \nThat’s when you hear the roar from the black.\n\nYou have a single bullet left.\n\n1. [[End Ryan's pain.]]\n2. [[Shoot the monster.]]"
"""Yeah, well, let's make sure he died for something worth dying for.""",""""Yeah,""" he says, not meeting your eyes. """I guess so."""\n\n"""He gave you a password, right?""" Strauss says. """Maybe there’s an autopilot sequence on his computer."""\n\n"""Doesn’t do us any good if that thing is still stomping around."""\n\n"""Do you really think it survived that blast?"""\n\n"""Is that a serious question?"""\n\n"""Either way, we need to get the ship moving. Let’s get to the cockpit and decide what to do there."""\n\nYou make your way toward the cockpit. About halfway there, Meat speaks.\n\n"""What was it doing when it killed Neil?"""\n\n"""Evolving,""" Strauss answers.\n\n"""Did you get a good look at it?""" Meat asks.\n\n1.[["""It wiggled a lot."""]]\n2.[["""I did not. I was too busy running for my life."""]]\n"
"""Well, you are ideal bait...""",""""When I was asking for support, I didn't mean that kind of support."""\n\n"""You'll be fine, son,""" Salvucci says.\n\n"""We'll cut that fucker down before it even gets close."""\n\n"""Reassuring. Really. So can I at least have the knowledge of where I'm going to die before we get there?"""\n\n"""Sickbay,""" Salvucci says. """Tight space, we'll wait on the outside."""\n\n"""Sickbay,""" Neil repeats. """I'm going to die in sickbay."""\n\n"""Just move it,""" Meat says. """The sooner we get there, the sooner we kill it."""\n\nYou notice a trace of uneasiness in Meat's voice.\n\n1.[[Onward to Sickbay.]]"
"""You're not even real.""",""""No,""" she says, turning away from you. """But it is."""\n\nYou turn just in time to make out the tentacle that rends your head from your body.\n\nThe last sound you hear is the beast roaring with satisfaction.\n\nThe End"
" Pull out your pistol and fire blindly.","Meat fires the rifle across the room, the gun’s light chasing Markie’s feet as she darts away. You raise your pistol and fire blindly in front of Meat’s light, hoping to hit her with a lucky shot. Beside you, Neil screams in terror.\n\nYou hear the tell-tell click of the rifle as the clip goes dry. Meat swings the rifle around to point the flashlight at the door.\n\n"""Go!"""\n\nYou all make a beeline for the door. Meat yanks on the handle and light bleeds into the darkness, as all three of you sprint into the hallway. You slam the door and then bend over to catch your breath. Luckily, you manage to pull back just in time to avoid the spew of vomit that erupts from Neil’s mouth.\n\n"""That was Markie—our Markie?""" he says, wiping the spittle from his lip.\n\n"""Yeah, it was,""" Meat answers, a tinge of sadness in his voice. He reloads the clip. """This is my last one."""\n\n"""Why didn’t she attack us?"""\n\n1.[["""She wants us to run out of resources."""]]\n2.[["""She’s toying with us."""]]\n\n\n\n"
"Also sulk in silence",""""Guess not,""" he says, seeing the expression on your face. \n\n"""I'll just go over here and play with this tablet."""\n\n"""Idiot,""" you hear Strauss mutter.\n\nYou take a seat on the examination table and look around the wrecked room. You're staring at the bloodstains left by Ben's corpse when the door opens and in walk Meat and Salvucci; both men wear dark expressions.\n\n"""I’m guessing your hunt was uneventful?""" Strauss says.\n\n"""Yeah, go on and rub it then,""" Meat says, turning to rifle through the medical cabinets.\n\n"""What are you looking for?"""\n\n"""Food."""\n\n"""This is a medical facility. What makes you think there’s food in here?"""\n\nMeat opens one of the lower cabinets and, after a moment, pulls out a large bag of apricot chips.\n\n"""Your assistant told me about his stash a while back."""\n\n"""I’m glad you can eat his food while his blood is smeared all over the floor."""\n\n"""Not like he’s going to need them,""" Meat says with a shrug.\n\n"""Enough you two,""" Salvucci barks. """Pilot, you all right?"""\n\n"""Yeah, I’m fine, captain. Thanks for asking."""\n\n"""Did you three see anything?"""\n\n"""No,""" Strauss says.\n\n1.[["""Where did you look?"""]]\n2.[["""Did it leave any sort of trail?"""]]"
"""We can't turn on each other, man.""",""""Sorry,""" he says. """She’s just getting on my nerves. I know she’s had it rough. She and Ben were a thing, so she’s on edge even more than usual, I guess."""\n\nThe two of you enter the cafeteria and then, after taking a precautionary look around, you go into the kitchen and begin to stuff everything you can get your hands on into the two bags you brought from sickbay: fruit chips, soda, water bottles, pastries, canned soup.\n\nWhen you’ve filled the bags, you leave the cafeteria and make your way to the common room. Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters of Earth—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n"""Run into any trouble?""" Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n"""Didn’t see a damn thing,""" Meat says.\n\n"""I’m telling you,""" Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, """we won’t see it until it wants us to see it."""\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n"""How’s your arm, doctor?""" Salvucci asks.\n\n"""Fine, captain. Thank you."""\n\nYou're a bit tired.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\n1.[[Talk to Neil and Meat.]]\n2.[[Take a nap.]]\n"
"Rock, Paper, Scissors","You go four rounds. Neil wins two of them (rock over scissors each time). You with the other two times, with paper over rock.\n\nYou’re about to start the fifth round when the second door to sickbay opens, and Meat and Salvucci step inside; both men were dark expressions.\n\n"""I’m guessing your hunt was uneventful?"""

"Lunge at Markie.","You push Neil to the side and ram the butt of the pistol into Markie's face. Flesh and pus and blood splash your arm; the revolting stench gets in your nostrils. You hit Markie in the face again and again. Her blood's on your face now, in your eyes, in your mouth.\n\nThe body goes limp. You stop. And then, finally having a chance to smell what you're covered in, you vomit.\n\n"""Julia?""" Neil says tapping you on the shoulder.\n\nYou respond by throwing up some more. You're lightheaded and swaying.\n\nNeil says your name again, but you can barely hear it over the screams, a woman hollering inside your head so loud it cracks the walls of you skull and sets your synapses aflame.\n\nIt's Markie. """Mine,""" she shrieks. """Mine!"""\n\nYou're falling. You succumb to the dark. But in that darkness, she talks to you. Her voice mingling with a deeper one, the voice of the monster. Of the thing that killed her and Ryan and Strauss.\n\nYou are mine, it says, but you're stronger than those who have come before you. I cannot break your will so easily, so I offer you an opportunity: allow what's happening to you to happen and we can achieve the destiny of my race together. You will be a legend. If you do not, we will find another way regardless. We've slept in the chambers of your planet for your species' entire existence, waiting. The stars are our destiny--not yours. Your struggle is inevitable. Join us for infamy or sacrifice yourself for nothing.\n\n1. [[Join it.]]\n2. [[Sacrifice yourself for humanity.]]\n"

"Look where she's pointing.","Markie's nametag, covered in grime.\n\n"""So, she's like dead, right?""" Neil says, picking gunk out of his hair. """We're safe now."""\n\n"""Why did she die, though?

"""Captain…""",""""I already took one risk today, Julia, and that got someone else killed. Superstitious or not, we’re doing this. Now come on."""\n\nSalvucci leaves the room. You turn to look at Meat. He’s pale.\n\n1.[["""Good luck."""]]\n2.[["""Be careful."""]]\n3.[["""You sick fuck."""]]\n"
