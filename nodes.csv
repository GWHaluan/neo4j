"Say nothing at all.","Markie sighs. The four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss. The area of impact stretches for miles.\n\n“I don’t even see a fucking twig, man,” Meat says.\n\n“It’s been over a hundred years since the impact. I think all you’re going find is dirt down there,” Markie replies.\n\n“Don’t forget the radiation,” Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n“That too.”\n\nMarkie peers down. “Zoom,” she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n“You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?” Ryan asks Meat. “I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y’ know? Girls go for that sort of thing.”\n\nMeat grunts. “Not my woman. She’s endowed, but it ain’t with brains. The humor would, uh, escape her.”\n\n“And the radiation,” Markie points out.\n\n“Stupid radiation. Ruining everything,""" Ryan says.\n\n"""Hmm. That’s interesting,” Markie says—it’s almost a whisper.\n\n1. [["""Well, out with it Mark. What is it?"""]]\n2.[[Let someone else ask.]]\n"
"Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.","Meat takes the walkie from you. """Doc,""" he says.\n\n“Please hurry,” she begs. “We’re in the cockpit.”\n\n“Hustle people,” Meat says, breaking out into a sprint. \n\nYou and Neil follow. \n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci’s leg and tearing away flesh and muscle.  Salvucci is against the cockpit’s door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is next to his body.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n“Conserve the ammo,” Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben’s neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate’s skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben’s youthful face glares at you.\n\nThe thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He’s closing in.\n\n“Well don’t just stand there—shoot him!”\n\nYou aim down the sight.\n\n1.\t[[Fire the gun.]]\n"
"Remain silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.","Above you you hear the roar of the Speedwell's thruster as the ship lands. The sound frightens the fungal crabs back into their home.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open.  Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\n\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n“Get her to sickbay.”\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. She's delirious now, stumbling. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n“What happened to Ryan?”\n\n“I dunno. I think the blood on Markie's suit isn't all hers, though."""\n\n“Damn it, Travis. What did you find down there?”\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n“Where’s she wounded?” Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she looks around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n“And I was young and we were running,” Markie rambles, “eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.”\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[“What’s she saying?”]]\n2.[[“What is that?”]]"
"""Someone dropped you on your head when you were an infant, didn't they?""","“It doesn’t work like that, Ryan. I’m reading at least seven tunnels, carved out exactly the same size.”\n\n“Meaning what?”\n\n“There might be something down there.”\n\n“Spooky,” Meat says, peering through the scope of his rifle at the expanse of the crater.\n\n1.[["""We should check it out."""]]\n2.[["""Yeah, no, fuck that."""]]\n3.

"""Lenore.""",""""I found out what the first symptom is. It's fear. I woke up and I could feel the disease incubating in my body.

Her footsteps (and screams) trail away.\n\nAfter three minutes, Salvucci says """She's had enough time. Let's go."""\n\nThe three of you run down the hall to sickbay. She's inside, screwing a hose into a black machine in the corner of the room. She looks up.

"Talk to Meat and Neil","You approach the table. Neil takes one of Meat’s checkers.\n\nThey look up at you.\n\n“Thought we’d see a lot of boring shit on this trip, didn’t expect to run into a fucking alien,” Meat says.\n\n“Is it an alien, though? I mean, maybe it’s just something that’s been in the Earth the entire time?”\n\n“Shut up, Neil. You know what I meant.”\n\n“Hey, I’m just saying that maybe we should be a little more careful about the terms we’re throwing around, y’know, for science?”\n\n“Just play the damn game. “ He turns to you. “How are you holding up, Julia?”\n\n1.[[“I’m good.”]]\n2.[[“Could be better.”]]\n"
"""Well, out with it Mark. What is it?""","“There are tunnels.”\n\nRyan turns. “Come again?”\n\n“Tunnels. In the crater. The last reconnaissance team didn’t say anything about tunnels in their report.”\n\n“How long ago was that?”\n\n“Seven years. Give or take a month.”\n\n“Erosion. Boom,""" Ryan says.\n\n1.[["""Someone dropped you on your head when you were an infant, didn't they?"""]]\n2.[["""Uh..."""]]\n"
"Pick up the walkie","You pick up the walkie. Meat takes it.  """Neil, are you okay?"""\n\n“She’s fucking here, guys. Oh Jesus, she reeks.”\n\n“Sit tight,” Meat says. He nods at you. Both of you creep to the door. Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with perspiration. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that’s not what’s making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n“Stay away from me,” Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n“Now,” Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn’t even have time to turn her head before machinegun fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You’re not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you.  Luckily, there’s not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n“Oh godfuckingshit,” Neil yells. “That was Markie.”\n\nStrauss emerges from the kitchen, a napkin over her mouth and nose. She takes one glance and then looks away.\n\n“So, we like win now, right? They’re all dead?”\n\n“Yeah, I think—”\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie’s hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump. He fires the rest of the clip into the corpse.\n\n1. [[Shoot.]]\n2. [[Run.]]\n\n"
"""Let's go see Neil.""","Salvucci nods. “That’s a good idea.  You take doctor Strauss and do that. Travis and I will go check engineering. If it's wounded and looking for some place to hide, there’s plenty of spots. Let’s meet back here in an hour.”\n\nStrauss scoffs. “You’re treating the beast like it's a wounded animal limping toward its doom. You’re wrong. It showed no hesitation when it attacked. It’s not afraid of us. It’s waiting.”\n\nSalvucci wrinkles his nose as he is wont to do when someone says something that annoys him. “Regardless, we’ll find the creature and put it down.”\n\n“Creatures,” she says, correcting him. “There might be two of them now.”\n\n“Noted,” Meat says, replacing the clip in his rifle. You realize now that he has the most powerful firearm on the ship.\n“If you two run into it or them or whatever, don’t try to fight. Just run. Come find us.”\n\n“We should stop talking and get on our way,” Strauss says gruffly. “Before it eats that damnable pilot, which wouldn’t be such a bad thing if we didn’t need him to fly the ship.”\n\n“Now’s not the time for jokes, Doctor,” Salvucci says.\n\n“Who says I was joking?” Strauss replies before leaving the room. You follow.\n\n“Zoe,” Meat calls right before you step into the hallway. You turn. “Be careful.”\n\n1.[["""Don't worry about me, ya big softie."""]]\n2.[["""Whatever."""]]"
"“What else are we going to do?”","“All right, let’s get down to the hanger. Just…do me a favor. If we’re about to get sucked into space, just fucking shoot me, okay?”\n\n1.\t[[“Will do, partner.”]]\n2.\t[[“Happy thoughts, Meat. Happy thoughts.”]]\n"
"Finish programming the pods.","Strauss shows up just as you finish. She smells like smoke.\n\n"""It's done."""\n\nShe takes off her glasses and places them on a table nearby.\n\nShe looks at you, tears in her eyes, and says """I just want to sleep."""\n\nShe gets into her pod without another word. The hatch closes over her. You get in yours and close your eyes as the hatch seals. Sleep follows.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod. \n\nBoth you and Strauss are transported to private rooms on the biggest military outpost in New Austin. You order steak and wine but find that you don't have an appetite. Some suits interview you and, after you answer every question, you're told that you'll be allowed to leave soon.\n\n"""Soon""" turns out to be three days. You and Strauss meet on the base. She seems paler and thinner.\n\n"""Can we get a drink?""" she asks. """I just want to go somewhere, anywhere but home first."""\n\n1.[["""Sure, why not?"""]]\n2. [[Go on home.]]"
"""I'm alive.""",""""A keen observerer, you are.""" His voice is twangy. Maybe you're on Mars somehow.\n\n"""No,""" he says. """You're not on Mars. You fell into a rift and got yourself stuck between universes. To tell you the truth, I'm more impressed by your survival instinct than anything else. I thought I had patched all the holes."""\n\n1. [["""Holes?"""]]"
"We need to draw it out.","“Okay, with what?” Neil asks.\n\nThere’s a moment of silence as you, Meat, and Strauss turn to look at Neil. \n\n“Oh,” he says, getting it. “Well fuck that.”\n\n1. [[“Don’t be a baby.”]]\n2. [[“We could just knock you out.”]]\n\n\n"
"""Are you two serious? This is insane!""","“I already took one risk today, Zoe, and that got someone else killed. Superstitious or not, we’re doing this. Now come on.”\n\nSalvucci leaves the room. You turn to look at Meat.\n\n1.[["""Don't get yourself killed."""]]\n2.[["""You sick bastard."""]]\n"
"""Home. Let's get the fuck home.""","“Yeah, let’s.”\n\nThe two of you walk back through the hallway leading to the hanger and then to the cockpit. The bodies of your crew are still there, including the headless corpse of Dr.Strauss.\n\n“I was hoping she got away,” he said sadly.\n\n1.[["""Ditto."""]]\n2.[["""What happened, happened."""]]"
"""That's better. Now, any idea on how we kill this thing?""",""""One, but we have to act quickly. Let's go to sickbay."""\n\nYou follow her. When you get there, she tells you to lock both doors into the unit. You do so.\n\n"""How many rounds do you have left?""" she asks as she pulls out a small brush and a flask of a yellow sticky substance."""\n\nYou hand her the clip.\n\n"""Okay, good, there's enough here."""\n\nYou watch her get to work. She ejects each bullet from the clip and then sticks her brush carefully inside the flask. Pulling the brush from the flask, she coats each bullet with some of the goo.\n\n1.[["""Explanation please."""]]"
"""So if we can't melt it...what's the point?""",""""I'm getting there. The viewport windows are bulletproof, but enough acid might penetrate all the layers. All it takes is one crack on the outside layer."""\n\n1. [["""We're gonna blow him into space?"""]]"

"“She wants us to run out of resources.”","“She’s doing a hell of a job of it, then. Played us like a fuckin’ fiddl—”\n\n“Julia! Neil! Anyone!” Your walkie comes to life; it’s Strauss, her voice filled with panic.\n\nYou pull the walkie off your belt loop.\n\n“Please help us!” Strauss cries. “The captain keeps shooting but it’s not doin—oh god.”\n\nNeil looks at you in horror. You click the button on side the side of the talkie. You say:\n\n1.\t[[“Hold on, Doc. We’re coming!”]]\n2.\t[[“Serves you right.”]]\n3.\t[[Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.]]\n\n"
"Blast 'em.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n"""Come on!""" Meat roars. """This isn't a fight we can win."""\n\nYou both retreat. """Neil,""" he yells into the comm. """Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here."""\n\n"""Coming as fast I can,""" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feelings in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You’ve covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n"""Markie,""" Meat says, """where's Ryan?"""\n\nShe stutters. """D...d..dead."""\n\n"""Fuck!""" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie. Her arm is wounded.\n\n1.\t[["""You alright?"""]]\n2.\t[[Stay silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.]]\n"
"“You better watch your tone, Doc. I’m getting tired of your bullshit.”","Strauss says nothing.  You can’t help but notice Neil’s grin.\n\n“When are they supposed to be back?”\n\n“An hour from when we left,” Strauss says.\n\n“How long ago was that?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m a doctor, not a timekeeper."""\n\n“Sheesh. Well, okay, so what should we do to pass the time?”\n\n“Time’s going to pass regardless of what we do with it.”\n\n“Right. So you’re going to sulk over there in the corner. Fine.”\nHe turns to you. “Julia?”\n\n1.\t[[Rock, Paper, Scissors]]\n2.\t[[Tic-Tac-Toe]]\n3.\t[[Also sulk in silence]]"
"Shoot Ben.","You go for your gun, but someone beats you to the trigger. A shot tears off Ben's lower jaw, sending it flying into the wall. The second splits his forehead. The body falls back onto the floor and continues to gurgle.\n\nYou turn to see Strauss holding up the captain's pistol, tears in her eyes.\n\n"""Doc,""" Meat says, but she walks past him and continues to fire round after round into the corpse. Ben goes silent and still.\n\n"""Lenore,""" Salvucci says, reaching out to comfort her. \n\n"""We have to burn him too,""" she says, no hint of emotion in her voice. """Don't touch him.

"""If it's airborne, we're dead anyway."""\n\n"""I'll go get some oil then,""" say Meat.\n\n"""And I'll check on the console in the cockpit and hope to god Neil had enough time or selflessness to set up our autopilot.

"“I know.

Let’s get to the cockpit and decide what to do there.”\n\nYou make your way toward the cockpit. About halfway there, Meat speaks.\n\n“What was it doing when it killed Neil?”\n\n“Evolving,” Strauss answers.\n\n“Did you get a good look at it?” Meat asks.\n\n1.[["""I didn't."""]]\n2.[[“It had a lot of tentacles.”]]\n"
"Talk to Salvucci and Strauss","Salvucci is talking when you head over. You can see that Strauss is smiling, but it’s a sad smile.\n\n“She was a strong individual,” Salvucci says. “I’ve had her on four voyages. One time, three years back, we were all on Europa at the hanger and everyone was boarding, and this guy sets off the detector. He opens his shirt and reveals enough explosives to decimate every person in the hanger. Meat, Me, couple of others have got our guns trained on him, but Markie-–she talked him down. She saw what nobody else saw:just a stupid kid gripped in the thrall of some fundamentalist nonsense. She saved at least one life that day, probably more.”\n\n“She was a good soldier,” Strauss says sadly.\n\n1.[["""She was."""]]\n2.[[“That’s funny coming from the person who was more than ready to put her down a couple of hours ago.”]]\n"
"Shoot Neil too.","You shoot Neil as well. His corpse falls to the floor. His lifeless eyes look up at you in confusion.\n\nWhat now?\n\n1. [[Wait it out.]]\n2. [[Kill yourself.]]\n"
"""You crazy bitch.""",""""I had to kill him, you understand?""" she says. """He attacked me."""\n\n"""That's fine, doctor. He wasn't Ben anymore,""" Salvucci says.\n\n"""Relax, doc,""" Meat adds, rifle aimed at her chest.\n\n"""He bit me,""" she says, holding up her arm to show the bite mark. """Shit, he bit me."""\n\nMeat narrows his eyes and holds the rifle steadily. No one says anything. Tears stream down Strauss' face.\n\n"""Maybe if I had more time I could...but I can feel it in me now, coursing through my body. There's blood in the back of my throat. Vision blurry. Minutes. That's how long this takes to change us."""\n\nShe looks at the pistol, turns it over in her hand as though she's seeing something she's never seen before.\n\n"""Kill it,""" she says. """Don't let it reach Mars."""\n\nBefore any of you can stop her, she's pressed the barrel under her chin and pulled the trigger. Red splashes the ceiling. Strauss falls foward, head smashing into the floor.\n\n"""Fuck,""" Meat yells.\n\nWhatever color was left in Salvucci's face drains. Meat, in a moment of calculated rage, lifts his foot high over Ben's skull and stomps it several times. The insides of the boy's head ooze out like the innards of an old tomato. After he's done with Ben, he steps over to Strauss' body and aims his rifle down at her head.\n\nHe looks at the captain, who nods. He fires four shots and obliterates the top half of the woman's face.\n\n"""Shit shit shit,""" he groans, stepping away from the mutilated corpse.\n\n1.[["""We should check on the pilot."""]]"
"""Do I look like a fucking scientist, cap?""","“What killed Ryan?” Neil continues.\n\n“Stop talking, Neil,” Salvucci says with a raised voice before turning back to you. “Maybe Strauss was right.”\n\n“Captain, I have to insist. Ryan is a childhood buddy. I know his family. Somebody tell me what’s going on.”\n\n“Ryan got killed by some fucking thing,” Meat says. “Markie got bit by these crab things and she’s infected with something. Up to speed, dipshit?

"“What do we do?""",""""Should we look for it?""" Neil says.\n\n“Fuck that!” Meat says, turning. He aims his assault rifle at the first speaker and dismembers it with a single shot. He takes the second, third speakers out of commission as well. The music is no longer overpowering, but you can hear its echoes in the hallway.\n\n“Brutal but effective,” Strauss comments.\n\nSalvucci frowns. “You’re footing the bill for that when we get back.”\n\nNeil raises his finger. “Guys, now that Julia is awake, I think we should talk strategy. I just finished with our travel projections,""" Neil says.\n\n“And?” Strauss says, as though she knows what’s coming next.\n\n“Well, it’s like you said, doc: not good. Two months to Mars."""\n\n“We could last that long,” Salvucci says. “We ration food, ammo, go in groups to the rest of the ship when we need supplies.”\n\n“Captain, permission to speak?” Meat says.\n\nSalvucci nods.\n\n“That’s a horrible idea. We’ve got guns. Why don’t we use them? For all we know, that beastie thing could be growing. We need to hunt it down and kill it now.”\n\n“Travis, I put a gun against Markie’s head and blew her brains all over the floor. Apparently the thing inside her shook it off and walked away. I don’t think bullets are going to save us.”\n\n“Then we destroy the body completely,” Meat suggests. “Shoot it, stomp it, burn it, and then jettison the motherfucker into space.”\n\n“Captain, I don’t like either choice, but I think the more cautious one would be eliminating its presence from the ship,” Strauss says slowly.\n\n“Didn’t you say something about it being airborne?” Salvucci asks. “Could killing it infect one of us?”\n\nStrauss sighs, shrugs. “There’s no way to be sure. I didn’t get to run any tests on it. However, I’d rather take a chance on that possibility than risk us starving ourselves into easy prey.”\n\nSilence fills the common room. Then—\n\n“What do you think, Julia?” Neil asks.\n\nEveryone turns to you.\n\n1.\t[[“Let’s kill it.”]]\n2.\t[[“Let’s wait it out.”]]"
"Continue onward to the mess hall.","You proceed into the mess hall.\n\n"""Check everything,""" Salvucci orders.

" Pull out your pistol and fire blindly.","Meat fires the rifle across the room, the gun’s light chasing Markie’s feet as she darts away. You raise your pistol and fire blindly in front of Meat’s light, hoping to hit her with a lucky shot. Beside you, Neil screams in terror.\n\nYou hear the tell-tell click of the rifle as the clip goes dry. Meat swings the rifle around to point the flashlight at the door.\n\n“Go!”\n\nYou all make a beeline for the door. Meat yanks on the handle and light bleeds into the darkness, as all three of you sprint into the hallway. You slam the door and then bend over to catch your breath. Luckily, you manage to pull back just in time to avoid the spew of vomit that erupts from Neil’s mouth.\n\n“That was Markie—our Markie?” he says, wiping the spittle from his lip.\n\n“Yeah, it was,” Meat answers, a tinge of sadness in his voice.

Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters of Earth—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n“Run into any trouble?” Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n“Didn’t see a damn thing,” Meat says.\n\n“I’m telling you,” Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, “we won’t see it until it wants us to see it.”\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n“How’s your arm, doctor?” Salvucci asks.\n\n“Fine, captain.

You grip the railing beside you.\n\n“Hold on!”\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they’re pulled as well. Seconds later they snap off and go flying into the black.  \n\nMeat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster’s fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n“Eat shit and die, you fuck!” Meat screams through the comm. You can’t help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n“We did it,” Meat says. “We fucking did it.”\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly.

You can smell her from here, but that’s not what’s making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n“Stay away from me,” Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n“Now,” Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn’t even have time to turn her head before rifle fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You’re not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you.

He falls back onto the console.\n\nGood child, the voice says. Now set a course for the human world.\n\nYou approach the console, pushing Neil's corpse out of the way. Neil was logged in, luckily. You play around with the settings until you find the autopilot and set a course for Mars.\n\nThe voice tells you it's proud of you and that great things await. It tells you to wait, so you do. Later on, your body seizes and you flop to the ground like a fish. You watch with a mixture of horror and fascination as your arm explodes, spraying blood, skin, and bone everywhere, to reveal a purple jagged claw.\n\nNow, the voice says, your work truly begins. You follow its instructions and penetrate the chest cavities of Meat, Neil, and Salvucci with your claw. An hour later they've all risen. Of course, they're not really the people you knew. They're walking cocoons, dead flesh nuturing future soldiers.\n\nIt strikes you as odd that you should feel no guilt, but you chalk it up to how quickly you're evolving. Maybe guilt was, after all, a weakness that needed to be culled. The closer you get to Mars, the more changes your body undergoes. \n\nFirst, another claw sprouts. Next, in your sleep, you lose your skin and find it replaced with a hard shell-like body. You teeth fall from your mouth and are replaced with the kind of teeth monsters in fairy tales have.\n\nWhen you're a day away from the red planet, your soldiers hatch. They look like smaller versions of you.\n\nThey are to obey your every command, the voice says. Do not disappoint us, child.\n \nSoon you have forgotten your human life and have not only come to terms with what you are, but you look forward to your duties. The descendents of your new species will sing songs of your exploits and worship the very ground you have tread.\n\nMars looms and with it, your future.\n\nThe End\n\n"

He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n“Get her to sickbay.”\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship.

You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n“And I was young and we were running,” Markie rambles, “eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.”\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[["""What the hell is she saying?"""]]\n"

I think all you’re going find is dirt down there,” Markie replies.\n\n“Don’t forget the radiation,” Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n“That too.”\n\nMarkie peers down. “Zoom,” she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n“You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?” Ryan teases Meat. “I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y’know? Girls go for that sort of thing.”\n\nMeat grunts. “Not my woman. She’s endowed, but it ain’t with brains.

"""Fire!"""\n\nThe three of you unload your clips into the vent. The destroyed cover falls to the floor. And then something else: A giant, bulbous, leaky sack that explodes when it hits the ground.

You put a finger to the wetness and come away with a red smattering. You look at Neil and see that he's bleeding from his nose. After a second, he notices too.\n\n"""I guess we're both infected now. Shit."""\n\n1. [["""Fuck. Guess the old man was right."""]]"
"Shoot her.","You shoot her in the face. Her corpse falls back onto the floor and is still.\n\nMoments later both Neil and Salvucci burst through the door. Salvucci's gun is in his hand.

"""Sweet dreams everyone,""" you hear Meat say right before your chamber shuts itself. \n\nSoon it's dark. You close your eyes. The world gets even darker.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, Meat, and Strauss are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nMen in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n"""Soon""" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, Salvucci, and Strauss meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in merriment, celebrating your survival, though you allow yourselves to mournfully drink a round and say small eulogies for the dead: Ben, Markie, Neil, Ryan.\n\nWhen you're all finished, you share a cab that drops you off at your respective addresses. You're the first. Your comrades tell you to call them soon just to check in. Inside your small house in the suburbs, you finally allow yourself a good cry. Not for the dead. Not for any reason at all, in particular, except that it's been inside you for so long, struggling to get out.\n\nA week passes. You're relocated to an analyst position on the military base. You hear that Strauss is working at a research facility in New Memphis. You never talk to her, really, but Salvucci and Meat send you emails all the time. Both of them have been reassigned to on-base positions; Meat's an instructor, and Salvucci can't tell you what he does. You imagine it has something to do with what you found on earth.\n\nYears pass. You never marry or have children, but you're never alone. Boys come and go, at a rate of about one every five years. You become attached to them all and break down in sobs when each one leaves. You never tell any of your lovers about your experience aboard the Speedwell.\n\nYou and Meat become close. You meet twice a week for lunch. On Wednesdays, you watch sitcoms; on Fridays, there's salsa night downtown. You get a dog. This is your existence and it proceeds one day after another.\n\nYou grow old; it's inevitable. Salvucci dies first. You and Meat attend his funeral. You both take bets on who's next; turns out it's you.\n\nYou pass away one night in your sleep, your dog curled up behind you with his snout against your back, the hound peacefully unaware of your endless slumber.\n\nThe End\n"
"Save yourself; leave him to die.","It's a hard choice, but in the end, you get to your feet and sprint past the monster as it slaughters Meat. You can hear his screams as you run down the hall. Soon things are mercifully silent. \n\nYou climb up into the ventilation and decide to make your base of operations there. You're a survivor, you tell yourself. All you have to do is stay alive two months. That's all.\n\nYou go, day by day, into the ship in search of supplies. You often go to the mess hall to stock up on food and bring it back to the vents. You run into creature twice. Each time it's grown bigger, nastier. The first time, you get away without a scratch.\n\nThe second time, a tentacle pierces your ankle. You still manage to hop away, but you can't climb into the vent because of your injury. You seek refuge in the darkness of the barracks. Soon every breath brings pain. You refuse to accept the hand you've been dealt, even when Strauss, a bullet hole in her forehead, sits down beside you to have a chat.\n\n"""You had a good run, idiot,""" she says. \n\n1.[["""You aren't real."""]]"

"“Grow some balls and ask her yourself.”","“Ouch! Yeah, you're right. Sorry. Dumb question,” he says sheepishly. “Kind of awkward to put you in that position anyway.

"Get out of there.","You both retreat. """Neil,""" he yells into the comm. """Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here."""\n\n"""Coming as fast I can,""" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You’ve covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n"""Markie,""" Meat says, """where's Ryan?"""\n\nShe stutters. """D...d..dead."""\n\n"""Fuck!""" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie.

"You go to the mess hall for a bite to eat.","The mess hall is rather small: two tables next to an enclosed kitchen. You find Meat sitting by himself, shoveling ramen into his mouth. A plastic cup filled with cheap whiskey is next to his arm.

Eventually you give up and retire to the mess hall where Salvucci cooks hamburger meat for you both. \n\nYou eat quietly.\n\nThe next day you all try again with various game titles to no avail. \n\n"""To think everything hinges on a goddamn video game,""" Meat says.\n\nFor days it goes like this, your ship still drifting in space. Eventually you run out of food. You all try for hours in desperation to magically conjure up the password, but it's no good. The three of you realize that at that point you're just making up titles that sound like video games: Masher Nasher, The Adventures of Wallaby Dingo.\n\nYou all make your way to the mess hall and sit quietly, removed from one another. You think of your home back on Mars. You're glad you didn't get a pet. You wonder if anyone besides your parents will mourn your passing. Will they ever even know? You stare out one of the hall's viewports into space, your grave. There are worse ways to die, you say to yourself, than floating among the stars. \n\nIt's hardly a comfort for you in the days to come. Eventually Salvucci takes his life, a gunshot ringing out on the far side of the ship, away from the mess hall, away from you and Meat.\n\n"""You know,""" Meat says one day.

You look around the tables and near the entertainment closest while Meat looks around the kitchen. Salvucci keeps his eyes on the door. Strauss sits at a table away from everyone.\n\nYou find a small bag of chips and pocket them. No monsters, though.\n\nMeat pokes his head out of the kitchen. """Nothing.""" He looks at all of you and shrugs his shoulders. """What now?"""\n\nAs if to answer him, a loud shriek erupts from the vent hanging over you all.\n\n"""A GIFFTTTTT,""" Markie screams from the vent.\n\n"""Oh god,""" Strauss says, backing into the wall.\n\n"""Kill it,""" Salvucci says, raising his pistol. You, Meat, and Salvucci fire into the vent.\n\n"""Don't waste your ammo. Just a few shots,""" Meat yells.\n\nYou fire half of your clip and lower your weapon. The vent cover drops to the floor. Meat and Salvucci lower their guns as well.\n\n"""We got her, right?"""

At first, you're not sure what falls from the vent.You see a small, almost circular object dropping through the air. When it hits the ground with a splat, you know what it is, but you can't bring yourself to look.\n\nStrauss' screams confirm your fears. You finally look down; it's Neil's head. Both his eyes have been gouged out and there's a jagged line of flesh and muscle where he was decapitated.\n\n"""A GIFT!""" Markie yells once more before you hear her scamper away further into the ducts.\n\n"""I told you,""" Strauss, the first to speak, says.

Ben’s body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n“Well, that’s good, all things considered,” says Meat. You step into the cockpit. The door slides shut behind you.\n\n“Here’s the computer.”\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you.

The monster’s mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattle snake.\n\nYou turn to look at Meat. He's being lifted into the air by one of the tentacles. His face turns red; he's slowly being choked to death.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Save Meat's life.]]\n2.

"""We did our best.""","He sighs. """I want to believe you, but...nevermind. What now?"""\n\n1.[["""We sleep."""]]"
"""It ain't your fault.""",""""They're all dead because of me,""" he says quietly. """I've never had people die under my command before. It's a strange feeling."""\n\n1.[["""Ben isn't on you."""]]\n2.[["""Let it go. I need you here and focused. We all do."""]]"
"Let ‘em burn.","You follow Salvucci as he leaves the room. Before you step out you turn to Meat. His face is pale.\n\n1.[[“Good luck.”]]\n2.[[“Be careful.”]]\n3.[[“You sick fuck.”]]\n"
"Run. Now.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n"""What are you doing? Run!"""\n\nYou both retreat. """Neil,""" Meat yells over the comm. """Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here."""\n\n"""Coming as fast I can,""" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You surge ahead of Markie and lose feeling in your legs, but somehow you keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but eventually you stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Meat running. Ryan is nowhere to be found. You’ve covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you watch her fling one of the crab creatures across the ground.\n\n"""Fuck!""" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces.The two of you rush over to her. She's holding her arm.\n\n"""It got me,""" she says; you detect fear in her voice. She turns to Meat.\n\n"""Where's Ryan?"""\n\n"""Goddamn fucking thing ate him. It ATE him."""\n\nMeat's answer fills you with dread. No one that close to you has ever died before. Your vision becomes unfocused. A slap on the arm brings you back.\n\n"""We've got company, Zoe. I need you here and now,""" Meat says, nodding at the mouth of the cave where the crab creatures are gathering. There must be thousands of them. Luckily, behind you, you hear the Speedwell land.\n\nMeat fires several shots at the crabs, but they don't seem to be leaving the cave anyway.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you—-his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster. He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n“Get her to sickbay.”\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n“What happened to Ryan?”\n\n"""He's dead, cap. Something got him."""\n\n“Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?”\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n“Where’s she wounded?” Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit. You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n“And I was young and we were running,” Markie rambles, “eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.”\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[["""What the hell is she saying?"""]]"
"""I'm fine. Stop asking.""","He looks away sheepishly. """Sorry."""\n\n“Stop trying to hit that, Ryan. It’s not gonna happen,” says Markie, the Speedwell's science officer.\n\nRyan waves his hands dismissively. The enforcer of the group, Meat, chuckles. “She told you.”\n\n1. [[Wink at Markie in appreciation.]]"
"""Move past it or more people are going to die.""","He nods. """You're right. Need to focus on the task at hand. What do you think it is you found on earth?”  \n\n1.[[“Cthulhu?”]]\n2.[[“No clue."""]]\n"
"Eat him.","You take your knife and slowly cut up Meat's body. It's messy work, dividing the flesh and muscle from the bone. You store the body in various bags that are then stuffed into the freezer.\n\nYou stay alive another week, but the ships never come. The will to live finally leaves you; you lay down on the floor and close your eyes. You would cry if you had the strength.\n\nThe last thing you feel is the cold of the metal floor leaving your cheek.\n\nThe End\n\n"
"“It was tempting.”",""""Right? She's awful. No doubt about it."""\n\nThe two of you enter the cafeteria and then, after taking a precautionary look around, you go into the kitchen and begin to stuff everything you can get your hands on into the two bags you brought from sickbay: fruit chips, soda, water bottles, pastries, canned soup.\n\nWhen you’ve filled the bags, you leave the cafeteria and make your way to the common room. Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n“Run into any trouble?” Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n“Didn’t see a damn thing,” Meat says.\n\n“I’m telling you,” Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, “we won’t see it until it wants us to see it.”\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n“How’s your arm, doctor?” Salvucci asks.\n\n“Fine, captain. Thank you.”\n\nYou feel tired.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\n1. [[Talk to Meat and Neil]]\n2. [[Go to sleep.]]\n"
"""Nothing to be done about it, I guess.""","He shrugs his shoulders. """I guess so."""\n\nYou both return to your group of friends to find that Neil is mooning the barkeep.\n\nWeeks pass.

You just love the view of the Martian landscape and Jessica, quite content not to move anything, is more than happy to oblige you.\n\nOne day you catch a glimpse of light reflecting off the glass window of the balcony. You step onto the balcony and look out across the red canyons of your planet just to take in the beauty of it all. This is your new life, you tell youself.

"""I'm so sorry, Neil.""","You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n“Tight fit,” he says. “I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.”\n\nYou look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n“Almost got it!” With one last kick, the cover comes free. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. \n\n1. [[Put your hand on his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Don't.]]"

"“We should check on Neil.”","Salvucci nods. “That’s a good idea.  You take doctor Strauss and do that. Travis and I will go check engineering. If it's wounded and looking for some place to hide, there’s plenty of spots. Let’s meet back here in an hour.”\n\nStrauss scoffs. “You’re treating the beast like it’s a wounded animal. You’re wrong. It showed no hesitation when it attacked. It’s not afraid of us. It’s waiting.”\n\nSalvucci wrinkles his nose as he is wont to do when someone said something that annoyed him. “Regardless, we’ll find the creature and put it down.”\n\n“Creatures,” she says, correcting him. “There might be two of them now.”\n\n“Noted,” Meat says, replacing the clip in his rifle.  You realize now that he has the most powerful firearm on the ship.\n\n“If you two run into it or them or whatever, don’t try to fight. Just run. Come find us.”\n\n“We should stop talking and get on our way,” Strauss says gruffly. “Before it eats that damnable pilot, which wouldn’t be such a bad thing if we didn’t need him to fly the ship.”\n\n“Now’s not the time for jokes, doctor,” Salvucci says.\n\n“Who says I was joking?” Strauss replies before leaving the room. \n\nYou follow.\n\n“Julia,” Meat calls right before you step into the hallway. You turn. “Be careful.”\n\nStrauss is waiting for you when you step outside. She’s holding her arm. There’s a patch of red coming through the white sleeve right above the elbow.\n\n“It’s not a bite,” she says, noticing your stare. “I fell when I was running and my arm took the fall.”\n\n1.\t[[“Don’t strain yourself then.”]]\n2.\t[[“I guess that means you’re useless in a fight.”]]\n\n"
"“You left him to die, you bitch.”","She glares at you and her lip quivers. You think she's holding back tears.

What about the creature?”\n\n“Meat’s burning the bodies.”\n\n“Why the everliving hell is that lumbering mountain of idiocy doing such a thing?”\n\n“He thinks they might come back.”\n\n“That fucking idiot! We don’t know how that infection works. It could be twice as deadly as an airborne virus. I need those bodies intact. Call him! Stop him!”\n\nSalvucci's face goes pale. “I don’t have a walkie."""\n\n“Run,” she says.\n\nAnd you do. As fast as you can. Inside sickbay, you find Meat, sitting down on the floor, staring at where the bodies should be, but instead there’s only a lot of blood and some meaty chunks.\n\nAn oil can, a bottle, and a rag are next to him.\n\n“Where are they?”  Strauss demands. “The bodies? Where are they?”\n\n“Oh good. You’re alive,” Meat says. You can feel the force of his eyeroll from here.\n\n“Where are the bodies? Did you burn them?”\n\n“No, doctor. As you would have gathered from the lack of smoke if you weren’t a nutjob, I have not burned a damn thing. I came back and they were gone.”\n\nStrauss approaches Meat, gets in his face. “Well did they just fucking get up and walk off?”\n\nHe yells back. “I don’t know! You’re supposed to be the doctor here.”\n\n“Everyone relax,” Salvucci says, voice raised.  Meat and Strauss calm down, each refusing to look at the other, each saying nothing.\n\n“We’ve got two missing bodies, possibly infected and mutated into hostile lifeforms.” Salvucci rubs his forehead. “I need thoughts, suggestions, anything. Where should we go from here?”  He turns to you first. \n\n1.[[“We should check on Neil.”]]\n2.[[“Let’s go hunting.”]]"
"“No.”","“So you’re just as lonely and pathetic as I am. Well, misery, company and all that, I suppose.”\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit. You knock on the door.\nNeil’s muffled voice comes from beyond the door: “Password?”\n\n1.\t[[“Uhh…”]]\n2.\t[[“42.”]]\n3.\t[[“Open the damn door.”]]\n"

"“Probably to put us on edge.”","“Well, we’re about to put an end to that shit,” Meat says as you approach the crew’s quarters. You see large cables running through the doorway; they lead up the wall and into the ceiling.\n\nNeil reaches up and runs his hand along the cables. He quickly pulls it back. “Augh! Fuck!”\n\n“What is it?” Meat barks.\n\n“Nothing,” Neil says, regaining his composure. “Just fucking slime. Oh god, gag a maggot,” he says. “This shit reeks.” He holds his hand up to the light to reveal a goopy, transparent liquid.\n\n“Hey, that looks a little bit like—“\n\n“Don’t you fucking say it, Travis.”\n\nYou examine the cables without touching them.\n\nMeat takes a look as well. “Seems like a complicated operation.”\n\n“What, turning on the computer, starting a program, and plugging in some cables?”\n\nMeat turns. “You didn’t see how feral this thing was—not to mention she’s missing a goddamn arm.”\n\n1.[[“It might be Ben.”]]\n"
"Use the saw.","You reach and grab the saw. Markie's about to leap atop you when you swing the heated blades into her right foot, removing it from the rest of her body. She topples back as the leg stump turns into a geyesr of black blood. You throw the saw at her face, blinding her with heat.\n\n"""Put her in the chamber!""" Strauss roars, pointing with her free hand at the cryochamber in the corner of the room. Meat and the captain are quick, grabbing the creature while it flails about. They pull it by the rotting arm to the chamber quickly. The pod hisses as it opens. Markie snaps at them, tries to attack with her claw but she can't get a shot in. She shrieks as Meat and Salvucci heave her into the pod.\n\nYou smash the control panel with your fist and the chamber closes. You can hear Markie's muffeled screams from within. She starts to smack the door with her claw; cracks appear in the glass.\n\n"""Whatever you're doing do it fast, doc.""" Meat says, aiming his rifle at the pod.\n\n"""Put your gun down and take this,""" she says, passing off the hose from the machine. Meat takes it. """Now, plug it into the port at the bottom of the pod. Hurry! And make sure it's plugged in tight."""\n\nAnother crack in the glass. Meat takes the hose and screws it into the pod's port.\n\n"""Let go!"""\n\nMeat backs away from the metal hose. Strauss presses several buttons on the machine.\n\n"""What is that?""" Salvucci says.\n\n"""It's the incinerator,""" she says, slamming her palm down on one last button. You hear the roar of the flames as they pass through the hose and into the chamber itself.The inside of the pod lights up as Markie's screams become even louder. \n\nIt beats against the glass harder with her claw, but it's useless. Within minutes the monster's been vaporized.\n\nFor a moment, no one says anything. And then, just as you're all about to take a breath, in stumbles what was once Ben. The creature, missing both its eyeballs, gurgles as it reaches out toward you with rotting hands.\n\n1. [[Shoot Ben.]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
"Give him a comfort pat and offer your condolences.","“Thanks,” he says, turning his attention to the viewport. “I have to tell his parents.”\n\n“Worry about that later,” says Salvucci. “Right now we need to—”\n\nThe alarm wails through the halls.\n\nSalvucci turns to Meat. What’s left of the color in Meat’s face drains as he gazes at the control panel.\n\n“Contamination in sickbay. Quarantine square’s been broken.”\n\n“What’s going on?”\n\nSalvucci is quick. “Neil, you stay here. We’ll lock you in so you’re protected. You two come with me.

"Take the shot anyway.","You squeeze the trigger. Neil's head swings right in front of the barrel when you do. His head pops. You scream as blood splashes across your face, but you continue firing until the clip goes dry.\n\nYou open your eyes. Neil's corpse is missing the top half of his skull. What was Markie lie absolutely still, the form riddled with holes.\n\n"""Julia?"""

Is it too much to humor me when I ask for a little reassurance?”\n\nSalvucci frowns. “What are you suggesting?”\n\nMeat looks down at the corpses. “I need oil.

"Shoot the beast.","You fire your last shot in the dark. The monster roars again and then you catch a glimpse of the monster’s hideous, reptilian face as it darts out and closes its jaws around Ryan’s head. \n\nLike fingers plucking a grape from a vine, the beast rips off your squadmate’s head, leaving a bloody and spewing stump behind. The squad vital monitor shrieks at you.\n\nYou flee.\n\nLooking over your shoulder, you watch as what’s left of Ryan is pulled out of sight.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie. Behind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the sand. You run toward your squadmates.  You’ve covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach them, Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fires several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie’s arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your empty pistol and bash the monster’s dome inward. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived, as Meat puts three rounds into the soft underbelly.\n\n“Fucking fuck.” He kicks the crab.\n\nYou turn to Markie, who’s holding her arm. \n\n1.[[“Is your suit ripped?”]]\n\n"

I’ll get our suits. Hurry, it can’t be far behind us.”\n\nYou deactivate the locks on the droids and catch the suit that Meat throws you. You’re just about to put the helmet on when you hear the clanging at the door.\n\n“It’s here. When it gets in front of the droids, shoot the hanger switch, okay? And for fuck’s sake, hold on to something.”\n\nThe door bursts open and flies across the hanger. In steps the monster, mouth stained with blood, eyes looking about wildly.\n\nIt takes a step toward you.\n\n“Over here, motherfucker!” Meat shouts through his suit’s comm.\n\nIt growls and moves toward Meat. Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall. He grabs onto a wall-railing.\n\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n“Do it, do it now.”\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he’s behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n“Hold on!”\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they’re pulled as well.  \n\nA moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster’s fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n“Eat shit and die, you fuck!” Meat screams through the comm. You can’t help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n“We did it,” Meat says. “We fucking did it.”\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly.

You realize that you’re out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nYou and Meat exchange no words on the way to sickbay. The door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube. She’s looking around wildly.\n\nYou smell gunsmoke. Ben has both of his hands wrapped around his pistol.\n\n1.[[“What happened?”]]\n\n\n"
"“Get out of the way!”","Before the words can leave your mouth, there’s a whooshing sound, followed by a giant spike tearing through Ryan’s chest, splattering the cave with red. Ryan’s pistol drops to the floor. He moans. \n\nYou cast your light on the protruding spike and realize, as your comrade is slowly being lifted in the air, that it’s a limb of some sort.\n\nMarkie’s voice barks over the comm. """Zoe! What’s happening!? Ryan’s vitals are dropping.” You fire several shots into the darkness. One of them slaps into Ryan’s arm; his blue eyes gaze at you in shock.\n\nMeat now: “Zoe? Answer us, girl. What the fuck is going on?”\n\n1.[["""We need to go. Now!"""]]\n2.[["""Ryan's chum."""]]\n\n"
"“Strauss is removing her arm.”","Meat makes a face. “Fucking nazi. It’s a tiny bite. Can’t they just disinfect it? It was bad enough losing somebody; we don’t have to maim her.”\n\n1.[[“It might be for the best.”]]\n2.[[“Yeah. It’s bullshit.”]]\n"
"Give Meat a chance to explain.","“He might come back, y’know?” Meat says. “Like a zombie.”\n\n“Stop talking,” Salvucci says. “We need to find Strauss.”\n\n“If she isn’t dead,” Meat says grimly, eyes set on what’s left of Ben’s face.\n\n1.[[“He said Markie chased her into the hall.”]]\n2.[[“Ben said Markie chased her into the hallway. She’s probably dead.”]]"
"Don't say anything to him.","Neil nods at you one last time. You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n“Tight fit,” he says. “I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.”\n\nYou look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n“Almost got it!” With one last kick, the cover comes free. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. \n\n1. [[Put your hand on his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Don't.]]"
"""I wish.""",""""You look better. Neil's already at the bar.

"""It's the bionic woman! Barkeep! I'm buying all this lady's drinks tonight."""\n\nYou take a seat next to him at the table. Meat sits next to you and nearly takes up your whole side of the booth.\n\nYou turn to Neil, who's bright red in the face.\n\n1.[["""What, no foam finger for me?"""]]"
"End Strauss' pain.","You fire a single shot. Strauss' head goes back and her limbs go limp. Markie turns to see all of you. She growls and drops Strauss.\n\nThat's when Meat fires at the control panel. Upon impact, the door dividing the hanger from the rest of the ship comes down, seperating you from the hanger. Alarms blare. You watch from the door's window as both Strauss' corpse and the creature are sucked out into space. You watch the two forms drift away until they're dots, inseparable from distant stars.\n\nNone of you give a cheer or breathe a sigh of relief, however. There's a sense of shame that hangs over all of you, an awareness of your cowardice. You played it safe so that one of your crewmates could sacrafice herself.\n\nThe auto-close kicks in and the hanger door shuts itself. The alarms cease their cries.\n\n"""We should go check Neil's console,""" Meat says.\n\nThe three of you silently make your way to the cockpit. Inside, you find the autopilot already engaged. The console is covered in blood; the pilot's corpse is behind it.\n\n"""He knew he wasn't going to make it,""" Meat says bitterly. \n"""Setting the autopilot must have been the last thing he did. Another goddamn hero."""\n\n"""Everyone who died here will be honored when we get home,""" Salvucci says. \n\n"""Oh good, because medals were really what I was concerned about,""" Meat says.

[[Ready the cryopods.]]\n\n"
"“You can’t be serious.”","“I already took one risk today, Julia, and that got someone else killed. Superstitious or not, we’re doing this. Now come on.”\n\nSalvucci leaves the room. You turn to look at Meat. He’s pale.\n\n1.[[“Good luck.”]]\n2.[[“Be careful.”]]\n3.[[“You sick fuck.”]]\n"
"""No, I don't.""","“So you’re just as lonely and pathetic as I am. Well, misery, company and all that, I suppose.”\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit. You knock on the door.\nNeil’s muffled voice comes from beyond the door: “Password?”\n\n1.[["""Open the door, numbnuts."""]]\n2.[["""Oedipa."""]]"
"""Let's go kill it.""","Meat nods. “Better than waiting around to die, I suppose.”\n\nSalvucci’s demeanor doesn’t shift. “If we’re going to do this, we need to have a plan. How many guns do we have?”\n\nYou all lay your firearms on one of the tables: one assault rifle with two clips, three pistols with 18 rounds each. In total, you have 94 rounds. You also have a Molotov cocktail, courtesy of Meat.\n\n“Is that it?” says Salvucci.\n\nMeat can’t hide his annoyance. “What do you mean ‘is that it?’ We have enough here to kill that thing fifty times over. Sorry, captain,” he adds quickly.\n\nSalvucci doesn’t bother acknowledging the insubordination. “All right, tactics time. Everyone knows the layout of the ship, correct?”\n\n“Two main hallways. Left connects to crew quarters, common room, cafeteria, engineering, cryoroom, and bathrooms. The other leads to sickbay, cockpit, and the hanger,” Strauss says quickly.\n\n“Pfft. Hanger, if you can call it that,” Neil says. “It’s barely big enough to fit our droids."""\n\n“Is that really appropriate right now?” Strauss says.\n\n“I’m just sayin’.”\n\n“The big question, then, is how we’re dividing teams.”\n\n“I’m with Meat,” Neil says quickly, eyeing the assault rifle.\nStrauss rolls her eyes.\n\n“What? I called dibs.”\n\n“Okay, so that puts Meat and Neil together. Zoe, you go with them too. Doctor Strauss and I will take the right hallway."""\n\n1. [[Follow Meat and Neil.]]"
"“I’m with Ryan.”","“In that case, I’m with Meat. Both groups will hike down the wall and take their respective tunnels. We’ve got the third one on the right,” she says, pointing. “You guys take the one over there.”\n\n1.[[“I’ve got a bad feeling about this.”]]\n2.[["""Roger that."""]]"
"Kill them both.","You take out the immiediate threat first, blowing Salvucci's mind out the back of his skull. The captain slumps.\n\nNeil puts his hand up to block the next round but the bullet tears through his palm and into his chest. He takes a step backward. You fire another shot. He falls back onto the console.\n\nGood child, the voice says. Now set a course for the human world.\n\nYou approach the console, pushing Neil's corpse out of the way. Neil was logged in, luckily. You play around with the settings until you find the autopilot and set a course for Mars.\n\nThe voice tells you it's proud of you and that great things await. It tells you to wait, so you do.\n\nLater on, your body seizes and you flop to the ground like a dying fish. You watch with a mixture of horror and fascination as your arm explodes, spraying blood, skin, and bits of bone everywhere, to reveal a purple jagged claw.\n\nNow, the voice says, your work truly begins. You follow its instructions and penetrate the chest cavities of Meat, Neil, and Salvucci with your claw. An hour later they've all risen. Of course, they're not really the people you knew. They're walking cocoons, dead flesh nuturing future soldiers.\n\nIt strikes you as odd that you should feel no guilt, but you chalk it up to how quickly you're evolving. Maybe guilt was, after all, a human weakness that needed to be culled. The closer you get to Mars, the more changes your body undergoes.\n\nFirst, another claw sprouts. Next, in your sleep, you lose your skin and find it replaced with a hard shell-like body. Your teeth fall from your mouth and are replaced with the kind of teeth monsters in fairy tales have.\n\nWhen you're a day away from the red planet, your soldiers hatch. They look like smaller versions of you.\n\nThey are to obey your every command, the voice says. Do not disappoint us, child.\n \nSoon you have forgotten your human life and have not only come to terms with what you are, but you look forward to your duties. The descendents of your new species will sing songs of your exploits and worship the very ground you have tread.\n\nMars looms and with it, your future.\n\n                      The End\n\n"
"""We need someone up in the vents.""","Meat raises an eyebrow. “The ducts?”\n\nStrauss gets it. “Of course. That’s how it could be traveling.”\n\n“Not good survival odds though, if someone finds her up there,” Neil says, eyes toward the ducts. “That close proximity? With bullets that don’t do shit? Yeah, I’m not gonna volunteer for that.”\n\n“Shit bird’s right,” Meat says. “If it is hiding up there, we need to figure out how to draw it out. If we go into the vent, we're fucking toast."""\n\n“What kind of insult is ‘shit bird?'” Neil mutters.\n\n1.[[Draw the monster out.]]"
"""Dangerous. I like it.""",""""In any other situation, your reaction would be troubling."""\n\nThe door behind you clangs.\n\n"""Shit,""" Strauss says, coating the last bullet. """At least we don't have to bait it now.\n\nA louder bang now. A tentacle penetrates the door.\n\n"""Come on, let's go!"""\n\nYou leave through the other sickbay door. In the hallway, she hands you your pistol. You find the viewport. It's a spacious square of glass that takes up half the wall. Behind you, there is the sound of giant, reveberating footsteps.\n\n"""He's coming. You get near the switch. I'll jump back after you shoot the window.""" Strauss positions herself near the window; you stand next to the switch. \n\nThe creature approaches. It growls as it lumbers toward the doctor. Both the monster and Strauss are close to the window now.\n\n1. [[Shoot the window.]]\n2. [[Shoot Strauss first.]]"
"Attack with your gun.","You grab the pistol from your holster. Too slow. Markie's atop of you, her semi-human hand wrapped around neck before you can even pull it up to chest level.\n\nYou aim upward and fire a shot into her chest. She looks down at you and smiles. The claw is surprisingly quick as it rips open your throat.\n\n"""Zoe!""" Meat cries, but you know you're a goner. You watch helplessy as Salvucci and Meat both tackle her. Strauss is screaming about the cryopod. Your vision is becoming blurry. \n\nYou hope your crewmates make it out OK and that they have nice words to say about you at your funeral.\n\nMost of all, though, you wish you had gone for the goddamn saw. You were so close to getting out of here.\n\nThe End\n\n"

Meat, in a moment of calculated rage, lifts his foot high over Ben's skull and stomps it several times. The innards of the boy's head ooze out like the insides of a old tomato.

It flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\n“Let’s do this,” he says, pulling out his pistol. You do the same.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head Up Display (HUD) of your helmet you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad.

Meat swings the rifle around to point the flashlight at the door.\n\n“Go!”\n\nYou all make a beeline for the door.

"“Zoe,” he says.","“Zoe, everything okay? You’ve got that look in your eyes.”\n\nRyan constantly feels some odd need to ask whether or not you’re all right.

"“Your bickering is going to get us killed.”","“Sorry,” he says. “She’s just getting on my nerves. I know she’s had it rough. She and Ben were a thing, so she’s on edge even more than usual, I guess.”\n\nThe two of you enter the cafeteria and then, after taking a precautionary look around, you go into the kitchen and stuff everything you can get your hands on into the two bags you brought from sickbay: fruit chips, soda, water bottles, pastries, canned soup.\n\nWhen you’ve filled the bags, you leave the cafeteria and make your way to the common room. Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n“Run into any trouble?” Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n“Didn’t see a damn thing,” Meat says.\n\n“I’m telling you,” Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, “we won’t see it until it wants us to see it.”\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n“How’s your arm, doctor?” Salvucci asks.\n\n“Fine, captain.

The thought strikes you that no one will ever know the sacrifices of you or your crew. You weep and Jessica asks what's wrong.\n\nYou lie. Just as you do when she asks you about the augmentations--the very ones she installed. """Accident in the cryotube,""" you tell her. You're so wracked with guilt over these lies that you make it a priority to never lie to her about anything else. For the most part, your relationship is one built on trust.\n\nThree years after your return to Mars you're married. It's a simple ceremony. Your parents show up, as do the surviving members of your crew. You eat cake. You kiss.\n\nYou move in with Jessica even though her apartment is smaller than yours. You just love the view of the Martian landscape, and Jessica, quite content not to move anything, is more than happy to oblige you.\n\nOne day you catch a glimpse of light reflecting off the glass of the balcony window. You step onto the balcony and look out across the red canyons of your planet just to take in the beauty of it all. This is your new life, you tell youself.

Dreamless sleep covers your eyes. Briefly.\n\nYou awaken to the sound of choking. The first thing you see through blurred vision is a blood trail on the floor.

All you have to do is stay alive two months. That's all.\n\nYou go, day by day, into the ship in search of supplies. You often go to the mess hall to stock up on food and bring it back to the vents. You run into the creature twice. Each time it's grown bigger, nastier. The first time, you get away without a scratch.\n\nThe second time, a tentacle pierces your ankle. You still manage to hop away, but you can't climb into the vent because of your injury. You seek refuge in the darkness of the barracks. Soon every breath brings pain.

She could expire and change at any moment.”\n\n“This is a bad horror movie,” Ben moans, staring into the glass while Markie gazes at her own cauterized stump. She’s drooling now and has a nosebleed. You can see black veins popping beneath the skin on her forehead.\n\n“Enough,” Salvucci says at last. “We’re not killing anyone on my ship—we’re not savages.”\n\nMeat seems relived. “Thanks boss.”\n\n“This is a mistake,” Strauss says.\n\n“Maybe,” he says, “but it’s my mistake to make, not yours. Do what you can to keep her alive and prep her for cryo sleep.”\n\n“Again, a mistake.”\n\n“Doctor Strauss, unless you want to be brought before a military tribunal for insubordination, I suggest you do as I say.\n\n“Yes, captain,” she says, voice calm, but there’s a fire in her eyes. “Ben, lower the temperature to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We’ll try to freeze her.”\n\nMarkie looks up at you all.

Maybe,” he says, glancing at his finger. “It hurt.”\n\nThe intercom clicks on before you can say anything. “All officers report to sickbay,” Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his bowl and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you’re out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nYou and Meat exchange no words on the way to sickbay. The door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube.

"Say nothing to him. Leave.","You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n“Tight fit,” he says. “I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.”\n\nStrauss follows Meat. You look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Strauss and Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n“Almost got it!” With one last kick, the cover comes free. Meat grabs Strauss and pulls her through. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently. \n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. Strauss looks on sadly.\n\n1.[["""Hey! Focus. I need you here.

If you spot it, call for help."""\n\nYou watch as Meat and Salvucci ascend the ladder.

You crawl slowly, pistol in hand.\n\n"""You know,""" Neil says after you've been crawling for five minutes, """I never thought I'd go like this.

He grabs onto a wall-railing.\n\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n“Do it, do it now.”\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\n\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he’s behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n“Hold on!”\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they’re pulled back as well.  \n\nA moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster’s fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n“Eat shit and die, you fuck!” Meat screams through the comm. You can’t help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n“We did it,” Meat says. “We fucking did it.”\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly.

Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters of Earth—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n“Run into any trouble?” Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n“Didn’t see a damn thing,” Meat says.\n\n“I’m telling you,” Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, “we won’t see it until it wants us to see it.”\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n“How’s your arm, doctor?” Salvucci asks.\n\n“Fine, captain.

This close, you can see that the iris of his remaining eye is yellow. You take aim again.\nSalvucci, standing on his wounded leg, beats you and Meat to it.\n\nThe captain grabs Ben by the side of his face and throws him into the wall. The thing moans as it hits the floor. It’s surprisingly quick to rise, but Salvucci already has the crowbar in his hand.\n\nHe grunts and brings the curved end down on the back of Ben’s head hard. The thing crumbles and is hit again as it slowly lifts its head. Red and yellow matter splatter the wall—little squirts at first, but they grow larger once the back of the skull caves in and brain matter flies. \n\nSalvucci drops the crowbar after the fifth hit and falls back onto the floor, out of breath.\n\nMeat approaches the beast. It slowly sticks its hand out toward him, fingers crawling across the floor like a wounded spider. Meat raises his boot above the monster’s head and stomps. Once. Twice. \n\nBen convulses. He goes still after the third impact. Meat steps past the body and helps Salvucci to his feet.\n\n“Holy shit, cap,” Neil says, looking at the leg wound. \n\n“I’ll brush it off,” Salvucci says, limping to the door.

Meat and Strauss calm down, both refusing to look at the other, both saying nothing.\n\n“We’ve got two missing bodies, possibly infected and mutated into hostile lifeforms.” Salvucci rubs his forehead. “I need thoughts, suggestions, anything. Where should we go from here?”  He turns to you first. \n\n1.[[“We should check on Neil.”]]\n2.[[“Let’s go hunting.”]]\n"
"Go ahead and shoot the switch.","Meat fires. Strauss' head falls back and her limbs go limp. Markie turns to see all of you. She growls and drops Strauss.\n\nThat's when you fire a single shot at the control panel. Upon impact, the door seperating the hanger from the rest of the ship comes down, dividing you from the hanger. Alarms blare. You watch through the door's window as both Strauss' corpse and the creature are sucked out into space. The two forms drift away until they're dots, inseparable from distant stars.\n\nNone of you give a cheer or breathe a sigh of relief, however. There's a sense of shame that hangs over all of you, an awareness of your cowardice. You played it safe so that one of your crewmates could sacrafice herself.\n\nThe auto-close kicks in and the hanger door shuts itself. The alarms cease their cries.\n\n"""We should go check Neil's console,""" Meat says.\n\nThe three of you silently make your way to the cockpit. Inside, you find the autopilot already engaged. The console is covered in blood; the pilot's headless corpse is behind it.\n\n"""He knew he wasn't going to make it,""" Meat says bitterly. """Setting the autopilot must have been the last thing he did. Another goddamn hero."""\n\n"""Everyone who died here will be honored when we get home,""" Salvucci says. \n\n"""Oh good, because medals were really what I was concerned about,""" Meat says. """I'm gonna go check the rest of the ship make sure nothing will snack on us while we sleep."""\n\n"""I'll go with you,""" Salvucci says. """Zoe, go make sure the cryopods are ready."""\n\n1.[[Go ready the pods.]]\n"
"""The fuck is wrong with you?""","Her lip twitches. \n\n"""Yes, I am fucking taking off her arm because it's required by protocol. So get out of here so I can do my fucking job. Thanks."""\n\nShe turns away from you to get to work. Ben looks from you to her without saying anything. He turns back to the tablet in his hands.\n\n1.[["""I am so close to shoving that saw up your ass."""]]\n2. [[Say nothing. Leave.]]"
