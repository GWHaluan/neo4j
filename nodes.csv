"""I don't.""","“Me neither,” he says, not meeting your eyes. That’s all he says on the matter. The week passes. He leaves. His wife, Rhonda, calls you a month later to tell you he passed away in his sleep. You can’t make the funeral because traveling would worsen your ailing health even more.\n\nYou wait. You spend days watching old movies. You try to make your way through a collection of Christine Love’s works, but you keep losing your focus.\n\nDeath comes when you’re sitting in your loveseat watching a news report on a bridge being built in a neighboring county. It is a quick, painful tremor that starts in your chest and spreads out.\n\nAnd then the dark sets in;you never expected slipping away to be this easy.\n\n<font size= "5" color="ForestGreen"><center>The End</center></font>\n

"“Burn her just to be sure.”","Meat nods. Twenty minutes later he’s scavenged the supplies for another Molotov. \n\nBoth of you return to Strauss’ body. You watch silently as it burns.\n\n“We shouldn’t move the bodies,” he says. “Might make us sick or something. Be a fucking shame to die over a little infection at this point,” he says, attempting to smile, but he can’t manage it. The will to smile or laugh has gone out of both of you. \n\nWhat future awaits you both now?\n\nYou both return to your cryo tubes and pop them open. They hiss and spew cold air on you.\n\n“Two months,” he says as he stares at the tube, which you realize now looks very much like a coffin. “Here’s hoping nothing eats us while we’re sleeping.”\n\nHe gets in his. You follow suit.\n\n“See you soon, kid.”\n\nYou press the button on the interior of the door and it slowly closes on your tube. You hear the seal clamp. A mist falls over your face.\n\nYou slowly closes your eyes and hope you wake up.\n\n1. [[Go to sleep]]\n

"Take a bullet to the brain.","You can't kill them. You thought you could, but you're not strong enough. \n\n"Julia, put down the gun...please,"  Salvucci says, hand reaching toward you as he approaches.\n\n"Where's Meat?" Neil asks.\n\n1. [["I'm so sorry."]]\n\n\n
