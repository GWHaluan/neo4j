"Say nothing at all.","Markie sighs. The four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss. The area of impact stretches for miles.\n\n""I don’t even see a fucking twig, man,"" Meat says.\n\n""It’s been over a hundred years since the impact. I think all you’re going find is dirt down there,"" Markie replies.\n\n""Don’t forget the radiation,"" Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n""That too.""\n\nMarkie peers down. ""Zoom,"" she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n""You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?"" Ryan asks Meat. ""I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y’ know? Girls go for that sort of thing.""\n\nMeat grunts. ""Not my woman. She’s endowed, but it ain’t with brains. The humor would, uh, escape her.""\n\n""And the radiation,"" Markie points out.\n\n""Stupid radiation. Ruining everything,"" Ryan says.\n\n""Hmm. That’s interesting,"" Markie says—it’s almost a whisper.\n\n1. [[""Well, out with it Mark. What is it?""]]\n2.[[Let someone else ask.]]\n"
"Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.","Meat takes the walkie from you. ""Doc,"" he says.\n\n""Please hurry,"" she begs. ""We’re in the cockpit.""\n\n""Hustle people,"" Meat says, breaking out into a sprint. \n\nYou and Neil follow. \n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci’s leg and tearing away flesh and muscle.  Salvucci is against the cockpit’s door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is next to his body.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n""Conserve the ammo,"" Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben’s neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate’s skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben’s youthful face glares at you.\n\nThe thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He’s closing in.\n\n""Well don’t just stand there—shoot him!""\n\nYou aim down the sight.\n\n1.\t[[Fire the gun.]]\n"
"Remain silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.","Above you you hear the roar of the Speedwell's thruster as the ship lands. The sound frightens the fungal crabs back into their home.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open.  Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\n\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. She's delirious now, stumbling. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""I dunno. I think the blood on Markie's suit isn't all hers, though.""\n\n""Damn it, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she looks around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What’s she saying?""]]\n2.[[""What is that?""]]"
"""Someone dropped you on your head when you were an infant, didn't they?""","""It doesn’t work like that, Ryan. I’m reading at least seven tunnels, carved out exactly the same size.""\n\n""Meaning what?""\n\n""There might be something down there.""\n\n""Spooky,"" Meat says, peering through the scope of his rifle at the expanse of the crater.\n\n1.[[""We should check it out.""]]\n2.[[""Yeah, no, fuck that.""]]\n3. [[Wait in silence.]]"
