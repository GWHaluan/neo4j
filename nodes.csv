"Say nothing at all.","Markie sighs. The four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss. The area of impact stretches for miles.\n\n""I don't even see a fucking twig, man,"" Meat says.\n\n""It's been over a hundred years since the impact. I think all you're going find is dirt down there,"" Markie replies.\n\n""Don't forget the radiation,"" Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n""That too.""\n\nMarkie peers down. ""Zoom,"" she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n""You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?"" Ryan asks Meat. ""I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y' know? Girls go for that sort of thing.""\n\nMeat grunts. ""Not my woman. She's endowed, but it ain't with brains. The humor would, uh, escape her.""\n\n""And the radiation,"" Markie points out.\n\n""Stupid radiation. Ruining everything,"" Ryan says.\n\n""Hmm. That's interesting,"" Markie says—it's almost a whisper.\n\n1. [[""Well, out with it Mark. What is it?""]]\n2.[[Let someone else ask.]]\n"
"Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.","Meat takes the walkie from you. ""Doc,"" he says.\n\n""Please hurry,"" she begs. ""We're in the cockpit.""\n\n""Hustle people,"" Meat says, breaking out into a sprint. \n\nYou and Neil follow. \n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci's leg and tearing away flesh and muscle.  Salvucci is against the cockpit's door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is next to his body.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n""Conserve the ammo,"" Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben's neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate's skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben's youthful face glares at you.\n\nThe thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He's closing in.\n\n""Well don't just stand there—shoot him!""\n\nYou aim down the sight.\n\n1.\t[[Fire the gun.]]\n"
"Remain silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.","Above you you hear the roar of the Speedwell's thruster as the ship lands. The sound frightens the fungal crabs back into their home.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship's elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open.  Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\n\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there's no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. She's delirious now, stumbling. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""I dunno. I think the blood on Markie's suit isn't all hers, though.""\n\n""Damn it, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where's she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie's drenched in sweat; she looks around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it's just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What's she saying?""]]\n2.[[""What is that?""]]"
"""Someone dropped you on your head when you were an infant, didn't they?""","""It doesn't work like that, Ryan. I'm reading at least seven tunnels, carved out exactly the same size.""\n\n""Meaning what?""\n\n""There might be something down there.""\n\n""Spooky,"" Meat says, peering through the scope of his rifle at the expanse of the crater.\n\n1.[[""We should check it out.""]]\n2.[[""Yeah, no, fuck that.""]]\n3.

"""Lenore.""","""I found out what the first symptom is. It's fear. I woke up and I could feel the disease incubating in my body. I started to cry only to discover my tears were blood,"" she says, turning to face you. \n\nHer cheeks are red with the blood flowing from her eyes.\n\n""I killed him out of fear, fear that you would all turn on me.  I was going to go back and do the same to you, and then to the others, but, well, what's the point? We're all gonna die in the end anyway,"" she says, sobbing. ""God, we're all going to die. Slowly. Bleeding out of our orifices. I did Travis a favor really."" She looks you directly in your eyes.\n\n""Please kill me. I don't want to die like Markie did. Please.""\n\nShe nods at your pistol.\n\n1. [[Shoot her.]]\n2.[[""Do it yourself.""]]\n "
"""Keep one bullet in the chamber for yourself...just in case.""","""Way to be an optimist, Julia,"" Meat says, clearly disapproving.\n\n""No, it's okay,"" she says, nodding. ""It's good advice."" She walks out the door and stars running. She screams ""Help!""\n\n""Five minutes,""  Salvucci says. ""That's all we give her.""\n\nMeat nods. Her footsteps (and screams) trail away.\n\nAfter three minutes, Salvucci says ""She's had enough time. Let's go.""\n\nThe three of you run down the hall to sickbay. She's inside, screwing a hose into a black machine in the corner of the room. She looks up. ""I told you to give me mor--""\n\nShe's interrupted by Markie's descent from the ventilation shaft onto the examination table. She growls at all of you. A giant purple claw has sprouted out of her missing arm. The other arm is rotting, like the rest of her body.\n\n""Prettyprettyprettypretty.""\n\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see the cauterizing saw on the table next to the bed. \n\n1. [[Use the saw.]]\n2. [[Use your gun.]]"
"Talk to Meat and Neil","You approach the table. Neil takes one of Meat's checkers.\n\nThey look up at you.\n\n""Thought we'd see a lot of boring shit on this trip, didn't expect to run into a fucking alien,"" Meat says.\n\n""Is it an alien, though? I mean, maybe it's just something that's been in the Earth the entire time?""\n\n""Shut up, Neil. You know what I meant.""\n\n""Hey, I'm just saying that maybe we should be a little more careful about the terms we're throwing around, y'know, for science?""\n\n""Just play the damn game. "" He turns to you. ""How are you holding up, Julia?""\n\n1.[[""I'm good.""]]\n2.[[""Could be better.""]]\n"
"""Well, out with it Mark. What is it?""","""There are tunnels.""\n\nRyan turns. ""Come again?""\n\n""Tunnels. In the crater. The last reconnaissance team didn't say anything about tunnels in their report.""\n\n""How long ago was that?""\n\n""Seven years. Give or take a month.""\n\n""Erosion. Boom,"" Ryan says.\n\n1.[[""Someone dropped you on your head when you were an infant, didn't they?""]]\n2.[[""Uh...""]]\n"
"Pick up the walkie","You pick up the walkie. Meat takes it.  ""Neil, are you okay?""\n\n""She's fucking here, guys. Oh Jesus, she reeks.""\n\n""Sit tight,"" Meat says. He nods at you. Both of you creep to the door. Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with perspiration. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that's not what's making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n""Stay away from me,"" Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n""Now,"" Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn't even have time to turn her head before machinegun fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You're not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you.  Luckily, there's not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n""Oh godfuckingshit,"" Neil yells. ""That was Markie.""\n\nStrauss emerges from the kitchen, a napkin over her mouth and nose. She takes one glance and then looks away.\n\n""So, we like win now, right? They're all dead?""\n\n""Yeah, I think—""\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie's hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump. He fires the rest of the clip into the corpse.\n\n1. [[Shoot.]]\n2. [[Run.]]\n\n"
"""Let's go see Neil.""","Salvucci nods. ""That's a good idea.  You take doctor Strauss and do that. Travis and I will go check engineering. If it's wounded and looking for some place to hide, there's plenty of spots. Let's meet back here in an hour.""\n\nStrauss scoffs. ""You're treating the beast like it's a wounded animal limping toward its doom. You're wrong. It showed no hesitation when it attacked. It's not afraid of us. It's waiting.""\n\nSalvucci wrinkles his nose as he is wont to do when someone says something that annoys him. ""Regardless, we'll find the creature and put it down.""\n\n""Creatures,"" she says, correcting him. ""There might be two of them now.""\n\n""Noted,"" Meat says, replacing the clip in his rifle. You realize now that he has the most powerful firearm on the ship.\n""If you two run into it or them or whatever, don't try to fight. Just run. Come find us.""\n\n""We should stop talking and get on our way,"" Strauss says gruffly. ""Before it eats that damnable pilot, which wouldn't be such a bad thing if we didn't need him to fly the ship.""\n\n""Now's not the time for jokes, Doctor,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Who says I was joking?"" Strauss replies before leaving the room. You follow.\n\n""Zoe,"" Meat calls right before you step into the hallway. You turn. ""Be careful.""\n\n1.[[""Don't worry about me, ya big softie.""]]\n2.[[""Whatever.""]]"
"""What else are we going to do?""","""All right, let's get down to the hanger. Just...do me a favor. If we're about to get sucked into space, just fucking shoot me, okay?""\n\n1.\t[[""Will do, partner.""]]\n2.\t[[""Happy thoughts, Meat. Happy thoughts.""]]\n"
"Finish programming the pods.","Strauss shows up just as you finish. She smells like smoke.\n\n""It's done.""\n\nShe takes off her glasses and places them on a table nearby.\n\nShe looks at you, tears in her eyes, and says ""I just want to sleep.""\n\nShe gets into her pod without another word. The hatch closes over her. You get in yours and close your eyes as the hatch seals. Sleep follows.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod. \n\nBoth you and Strauss are transported to private rooms on the biggest military outpost in New Austin. You order steak and wine but find that you don't have an appetite. Some suits interview you and, after you answer every question, you're told that you'll be allowed to leave soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days. You and Strauss meet on the base. She seems paler and thinner.\n\n""Can we get a drink?"" she asks. ""I just want to go somewhere, anywhere but home first.""\n\n1.[[""Sure, why not?""]]\n2. [[Go on home.]]"
"""I'm alive.""","""A keen observerer, you are."" His voice is twangy. Maybe you're on Mars somehow.\n\n""No,"" he says. ""You're not on Mars. You fell into a rift and got yourself stuck between universes. To tell you the truth, I'm more impressed by your survival instinct than anything else. I thought I had patched all the holes.""\n\n1. [[""Holes?""]]"
"We need to draw it out.","""Okay, with what?"" Neil asks.\n\nThere's a moment of silence as you, Meat, and Strauss turn to look at Neil. \n\n""Oh,"" he says, getting it. ""Well fuck that.""\n\n1. [[""Don't be a baby.""]]\n2. [[""We could just knock you out.""]]\n\n\n"
"""Are you two serious? This is insane!""","""I already took one risk today, Zoe, and that got someone else killed. Superstitious or not, we're doing this. Now come on.""\n\nSalvucci leaves the room. You turn to look at Meat.\n\n1.[[""Don't get yourself killed.""]]\n2.[[""You sick bastard.""]]\n"
"""Home. Let's get the fuck home.""","""Yeah, let's.""\n\nThe two of you walk back through the hallway leading to the hanger and then to the cockpit. The bodies of your crew are still there, including the headless corpse of Dr.Strauss.\n\n""I was hoping she got away,"" he said sadly.\n\n1.[[""Ditto.""]]\n2.[[""What happened, happened.""]]"
"""That's better. Now, any idea on how we kill this thing?""","""One, but we have to act quickly. Let's go to sickbay.""\n\nYou follow her. When you get there, she tells you to lock both doors into the unit. You do so.\n\n""How many rounds do you have left?"" she asks as she pulls out a small brush and a flask of a yellow sticky substance.""\n\nYou hand her the clip.\n\n""Okay, good, there's enough here.""\n\nYou watch her get to work. She ejects each bullet from the clip and then sticks her brush carefully inside the flask. Pulling the brush from the flask, she coats each bullet with some of the goo.\n\n1.[[""Explanation please.""]]"
"""So if we can't melt it...what's the point?""","""I'm getting there. The viewport windows are bulletproof, but enough acid might penetrate all the layers. All it takes is one crack on the outside layer.""\n\n1. [[""We're gonna blow him into space?""]]"
"""Most people would say 'thank you.'""","""You're right. You saved my life and I'm grateful for that. I just hope you did more than briefly delay my demise.""\n\n1.[[""That's better. Now, any idea on how we kill this thing?""]]"
"""She wants us to run out of resources.""","""She's doing a hell of a job of it, then. Played us like a fuckin' fiddl—""\n\n""Julia! Neil! Anyone!"" Your walkie comes to life; it's Strauss, her voice filled with panic.\n\nYou pull the walkie off your belt loop.\n\n""Please help us!"" Strauss cries. ""The captain keeps shooting but it's not doin—oh god.""\n\nNeil looks at you in horror. You click the button on side the side of the talkie. You say:\n\n1.\t[[""Hold on, Doc. We're coming!""]]\n2.\t[[""Serves you right.""]]\n3.\t[[Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.]]\n\n"
"Blast 'em.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n""Come on!"" Meat roars. ""This isn't a fight we can win.""\n\nYou both retreat. ""Neil,"" he yells into the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feelings in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You've covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n""Markie,"" Meat says, ""where's Ryan?""\n\nShe stutters. ""D...d..dead.""\n\n""Fuck!"" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie. Her arm is wounded.\n\n1.\t[[""You alright?""]]\n2.\t[[Stay silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.]]\n"
"""You better watch your tone, Doc. I'm getting tired of your bullshit.""","Strauss says nothing.  You can't help but notice Neil's grin.\n\n""When are they supposed to be back?""\n\n""An hour from when we left,"" Strauss says.\n\n""How long ago was that?""\n\n""I don't know. I'm a doctor, not a timekeeper.""\n\n""Sheesh. Well, okay, so what should we do to pass the time?""\n\n""Time's going to pass regardless of what we do with it.""\n\n""Right. So you're going to sulk over there in the corner. Fine.""\nHe turns to you. ""Julia?""\n\n1.\t[[Rock, Paper, Scissors]]\n2.\t[[Tic-Tac-Toe]]\n3.\t[[Also sulk in silence]]"
"Shoot Ben.","You go for your gun, but someone beats you to the trigger. A shot tears off Ben's lower jaw, sending it flying into the wall. The second splits his forehead. The body falls back onto the floor and continues to gurgle.\n\nYou turn to see Strauss holding up the captain's pistol, tears in her eyes.\n\n""Doc,"" Meat says, but she walks past him and continues to fire round after round into the corpse. Ben goes silent and still.\n\n""Lenore,"" Salvucci says, reaching out to comfort her. \n\n""We have to burn him too,"" she says, no hint of emotion in her voice. ""Don't touch him. Don't want to risk infection anymore than we possibly have.""\n\n""What about airborne infection?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n""What of it?"" she says. ""If it's airborne, we're dead anyway.""\n\n""I'll go get some oil then,"" say Meat.\n\n""And I'll check on the console in the cockpit and hope to god Neil had enough time or selflessness to set up our autopilot. Julia, why don't you go get our cryopods ready?""\n\n1. [[Set up the cryopods.]]\n"
"""We kill it.""","""With what? Pistol rounds ain't gonna put that motherfucker down, Z.""\n\n1.[[""With fisticuffs.""]]\n2.[[""The hanger. We can use the hanger.""]]\n"
"""I know. Now let's make it count.""","""Yeah,"" he says, not meeting your eyes. ""I guess so.""\n\n""He gave you a password, right?"" Strauss says. ""Maybe there's an autopilot sequence on his computer.""\n\n""Doesn't do us any good if that thing is still stomping around.""\n\n""Do you really think it survived that blast?""\n\n""Is that a serious question?""\n\n""Either way, we need to get the ship moving. Let's get to the cockpit and decide what to do there.""\n\nYou make your way toward the cockpit. About halfway there, Meat speaks.\n\n""What was it doing when it killed Neil?""\n\n""Evolving,"" Strauss answers.\n\n""Did you get a good look at it?"" Meat asks.\n\n1.[[""I didn't.""]]\n2.[[""It had a lot of tentacles.""]]\n"
"Talk to Salvucci and Strauss","Salvucci is talking when you head over. You can see that Strauss is smiling, but it's a sad smile.\n\n""She was a strong individual,"" Salvucci says. ""I've had her on four voyages. One time, three years back, we were all on Europa at the hanger and everyone was boarding, and this guy sets off the detector. He opens his shirt and reveals enough explosives to decimate every person in the hanger. Meat, Me, couple of others have got our guns trained on him, but Markie-–she talked him down. She saw what nobody else saw:just a stupid kid gripped in the thrall of some fundamentalist nonsense. She saved at least one life that day, probably more.""\n\n""She was a good soldier,"" Strauss says sadly.\n\n1.[[""She was.""]]\n2.[[""That's funny coming from the person who was more than ready to put her down a couple of hours ago.""]]\n"
"Shoot Neil too.","You shoot Neil as well. His corpse falls to the floor. His lifeless eyes look up at you in confusion.\n\nWhat now?\n\n1. [[Wait it out.]]\n2. [[Kill yourself.]]\n"
"""You crazy bitch.""","""I had to kill him, you understand?"" she says. ""He attacked me.""\n\n""That's fine, doctor. He wasn't Ben anymore,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Relax, doc,"" Meat adds, rifle aimed at her chest.\n\n""He bit me,"" she says, holding up her arm to show the bite mark. ""Shit, he bit me.""\n\nMeat narrows his eyes and holds the rifle steadily. No one says anything. Tears stream down Strauss' face.\n\n""Maybe if I had more time I could...but I can feel it in me now, coursing through my body. There's blood in the back of my throat. Vision blurry. Minutes. That's how long this takes to change us.""\n\nShe looks at the pistol, turns it over in her hand as though she's seeing something she's never seen before.\n\n""Kill it,"" she says. ""Don't let it reach Mars.""\n\nBefore any of you can stop her, she's pressed the barrel under her chin and pulled the trigger. Red splashes the ceiling. Strauss falls foward, head smashing into the floor.\n\n""Fuck,"" Meat yells.\n\nWhatever color was left in Salvucci's face drains. Meat, in a moment of calculated rage, lifts his foot high over Ben's skull and stomps it several times. The insides of the boy's head ooze out like the innards of an old tomato. After he's done with Ben, he steps over to Strauss' body and aims his rifle down at her head.\n\nHe looks at the captain, who nods. He fires four shots and obliterates the top half of the woman's face.\n\n""Shit shit shit,"" he groans, stepping away from the mutilated corpse.\n\n1.[[""We should check on the pilot.""]]"
"""Do I look like a fucking scientist, cap?""","""What killed Ryan?"" Neil continues.\n\n""Stop talking, Neil,"" Salvucci says with a raised voice before turning back to you. ""Maybe Strauss was right.""\n\n""Captain, I have to insist. Ryan is a childhood buddy. I know his family. Somebody tell me what's going on.""\n\n""Ryan got killed by some fucking thing,"" Meat says. ""Markie got bit by these crab things and she's infected with something. Up to speed, dipshit? Let the adults talk now.""\n\nNeil sinks back into his chair. ""He's dead,"" he says in disbelief.\n\n1.[[""We're going to be that way too if we don't get our head in the game, Neil.""]]\n2.[[""Suck it up, Neil. Cry later.""]]"
"""What do we do?""","""Should we look for it?"" Neil says.\n\n""Fuck that!"" Meat says, turning. He aims his assault rifle at the first speaker and dismembers it with a single shot. He takes the second, third speakers out of commission as well. The music is no longer overpowering, but you can hear its echoes in the hallway.\n\n""Brutal but effective,"" Strauss comments.\n\nSalvucci frowns. ""You're footing the bill for that when we get back.""\n\nNeil raises his finger. ""Guys, now that Julia is awake, I think we should talk strategy. I just finished with our travel projections,"" Neil says.\n\n""And?"" Strauss says, as though she knows what's coming next.\n\n""Well, it's like you said, doc: not good. Two months to Mars.""\n\n""We could last that long,"" Salvucci says. ""We ration food, ammo, go in groups to the rest of the ship when we need supplies.""\n\n""Captain, permission to speak?"" Meat says.\n\nSalvucci nods.\n\n""That's a horrible idea. We've got guns. Why don't we use them? For all we know, that beastie thing could be growing. We need to hunt it down and kill it now.""\n\n""Travis, I put a gun against Markie's head and blew her brains all over the floor. Apparently the thing inside her shook it off and walked away. I don't think bullets are going to save us.""\n\n""Then we destroy the body completely,"" Meat suggests. ""Shoot it, stomp it, burn it, and then jettison the motherfucker into space.""\n\n""Captain, I don't like either choice, but I think the more cautious one would be eliminating its presence from the ship,"" Strauss says slowly.\n\n""Didn't you say something about it being airborne?"" Salvucci asks. ""Could killing it infect one of us?""\n\nStrauss sighs, shrugs. ""There's no way to be sure. I didn't get to run any tests on it. However, I'd rather take a chance on that possibility than risk us starving ourselves into easy prey.""\n\nSilence fills the common room. Then—\n\n""What do you think, Julia?"" Neil asks.\n\nEveryone turns to you.\n\n1.\t[[""Let's kill it.""]]\n2.\t[[""Let's wait it out.""]]"
"Continue onward to the mess hall.","You proceed into the mess hall.\n\n""Check everything,"" Salvucci orders. You check around the tables and near the entertainment closest while Meat looks around the kitchen. Salvucci keeps his eyes on the door.\n\nYou find some of you soy raisin cookies and pocket them. No monsters, though.\n\nMeat pokes his head out of the kitchen. ""Nothing.""\n\n""Shit,"" Salvucci says. ""I guess we should go to the ba--"" A high-pitched scream cuts him off. Then, gunfire.\n\n""Strauss,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Well, come on, let's go,"" Meat says, running out of the kitchen, rifle in hands.\n\nAll of you run out the door and down the hallway toward Neil's cockpit. You're halfway there when you spot a sticky mass of flesh and blonde hair on the ground.\n\n""It's Ben,"" Meat says.\n\nYou're almost to the body when Strauss, hair a mess and her cheek dripping with blood, steps out from the corner. Her shaky hands are gripped around the captain's pistol, a gun aimed at all three of you.\n\n1. [[""Doc, put the gun down.""]]\n\n"
"""Got it.""","The groups go their separate ways; you hike down the cliff with Meat. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel. You step inside.\n\n""Let's get our lights on.""\n\nYou both tell your suits to turn your on your light attachments. You flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head-Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. You see that yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\nYou proceed through the cave.\n\n""You know what I want?""

"""We need to go. Now!""","""Meet us at the center of the crater!"" Markie yells over the comm.\n\nYou look at Ryan's heart monitor: he's about to flatline.\n \nThat's when you hear the roar from the black.\n\nYou have a single bullet left.\n\n1. [[End Ryan's pain.]]\n2. [[Shoot the monster.]]"

" Pull out your pistol and fire blindly.","Meat fires the rifle across the room, the gun's light chasing Markie's feet as she darts away. You raise your pistol and fire blindly in front of Meat's light, hoping to hit her with a lucky shot. Beside you, Neil screams in terror.\n\nYou hear the tell-tell click of the rifle as the clip goes dry. Meat swings the rifle around to point the flashlight at the door.\n\n""Go!""\n\nYou all make a beeline for the door. Meat yanks on the handle and light bleeds into the darkness, as all three of you sprint into the hallway. You slam the door and then bend over to catch your breath. Luckily, you manage to pull back just in time to avoid the spew of vomit that erupts from Neil's mouth.\n\n""That was Markie—our Markie?"" he says, wiping the spittle from his lip.\n\n""Yeah, it was,"" Meat answers, a tinge of sadness in his voice.

"""We can't turn on each other, man.""","""Sorry,"" he says. ""She's just getting on my nerves. I know she's had it rough. She and Ben were a thing, so she's on edge even more than usual, I guess.""\n\nThe two of you enter the cafeteria and then, after taking a precautionary look around, you go into the kitchen and begin to stuff everything you can get your hands on into the two bags you brought from sickbay: fruit chips, soda, water bottles, pastries, canned soup.\n\nWhen you've filled the bags, you leave the cafeteria and make your way to the common room. Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters of Earth—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n""Run into any trouble?""

"Lunge at Markie.","You push Neil to the side and ram the butt of the pistol into Markie's face. Flesh and pus and blood splash your arm; the revolting stench gets in your nostrils. You hit Markie in the face again and again. Her blood's on your face now, in your eyes, in your mouth.\n\nThe body goes limp. You stop. And then, finally having a chance to smell what you're covered in, you vomit.\n\n""Julia?"" Neil says tapping you on the shoulder.\n\nYou respond by throwing up some more.

""Mine,"" she shrieks. ""Mine!""\n\nYou're falling. You succumb to the dark. But in that darkness, she talks to you. Her voice mingling with a deeper one, the voice of the monster.

I cannot break your will so easily, so I offer you an opportunity: allow what's happening to you to happen and we can achieve the destiny of my race together. You will be a legend. If you do not, we will find another way regardless. We've slept in the chambers of your planet for your species' entire existence, waiting. The stars are our destiny--not yours.

""Travis...""\n\n""She would have killed us, man; the moment she saw any of us as a threat, she would have killed us without a thought, just to save her sorry hide.

"""Stay alive.""","""You too, princess.""\n\nHe gets in position. A second later, the door bursts open and flies across the hanger.

Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall. He grabs onto a wall-railing.\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n""Do it, do it now.""\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he's behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n""Hold on!""\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they're pulled as well. Seconds later they snap off and go flying into the black.  \n\nMeat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster's fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm. You can't help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n""We did it,"" Meat says. ""We fucking did it.""\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly. You both laugh. \n\n""We're alive!""\n\n1.[[""Come on. Let's get out of here.""]]"

In the hallway, she hands you your pistol. You find the viewport. It's a spacious square of glass that takes up half the wall. Behind you, there is the sound of giant, reveberating footsteps.\n\n""He's coming. You get near the switch. I'll jump back after you shoot the window."" Strauss positions herself near the window; you stand next to the switch. \n\nThe creature approaches. It growls as it lumbers toward the doctor.

"Save yourself.","It's a hard choice, but in the end, you get to your feet and sprint past the monster as it slaughters Strauss and Meat. You can hear their screams as you run down the hall. Soon things are mercifully silent. \n\nYou climb up into the ventilation and decide to make your base of operations there. You're a survivor, you tell yourself. All you have to do is stay alive two months. That's all.\n\nYou go, day by day, into the ship in search of supplies. You often go to the mess hall to stock up on food and bring it back to the vents. You run into the creature twice. Each time it's grown bigger, nastier. The first time, you get away without a scratch.\n\nThe second time, a tentacle pierces your ankle. You still manage to hop away, but you can't climb into the vent because of your injury. You seek refuge in the darkness of the barracks. Soon every breath brings pain. You refuse to accept the hand you've been dealt, even when Strauss, half her head missing, sits down beside you to have a chat.\n\n""You had a good run, idiot,"" she says.

Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with perspiration. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that's not what's making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n""Stay away from me,"" Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n""Now,"" Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn't even have time to turn her head before rifle fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You're not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you. Luckily, there's not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n""Oh godfuckingshit,"" Neil yells. ""That was Markie.""\n\nHe takes a step closer to the body.\n\n""So, we like win now, right? They're all dead?""\n\n""Yeah, I think—""\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie's hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump. He fires the rest of the clip into the corpse.\n\n1. [[Shoot it!]]\n2. [[Dart into the kitchen.]]\n"
"End your life.","No sense in delaying the inevitable.\n\nYou press the gun against your temple. You pull the trigger.

"Murder both of them.","You take out the immiediate threat first, blowing Salvucci's mind out the back of his skull. The captain slumps.\n\nNeil puts his hand up to block the next round but the bullet tears through his palm and into his chest. He takes a step backward. You fire another shot. He falls back onto the console.\n\nGood child, the voice says. Now set a course for the human world.\n\nYou approach the console, pushing Neil's corpse out of the way. Neil was logged in, luckily. You play around with the settings until you find the autopilot and set a course for Mars.\n\nThe voice tells you it's proud of you and that great things await. It tells you to wait, so you do. Later on, your body seizes and you flop to the ground like a fish. You watch with a mixture of horror and fascination as your arm explodes, spraying blood, skin, and bone everywhere, to reveal a purple jagged claw.\n\nNow, the voice says, your work truly begins. You follow its instructions and penetrate the chest cavities of Meat, Neil, and Salvucci with your claw. An hour later they've all risen. Of course, they're not really the people you knew. They're walking cocoons, dead flesh nuturing future soldiers.\n\nIt strikes you as odd that you should feel no guilt, but you chalk it up to how quickly you're evolving. Maybe guilt was, after all, a weakness that needed to be culled. The closer you get to Mars, the more changes your body undergoes. \n\nFirst, another claw sprouts. Next, in your sleep, you lose your skin and find it replaced with a hard shell-like body. You teeth fall from your mouth and are replaced with the kind of teeth monsters in fairy tales have.\n\nWhen you're a day away from the red planet, your soldiers hatch. They look like smaller versions of you.\n\nThey are to obey your every command, the voice says. Do not disappoint us, child.\n \nSoon you have forgotten your human life and have not only come to terms with what you are, but you look forward to your duties. The descendents of your new species will sing songs of your exploits and worship the very ground you have tread.\n\nMars looms and with it, your future.\n\nThe End\n\n"

""Make sure you have your gun ready, okay? I don't want Neil to get eaten because we ran dry.""\n\nYou check your pistol to make sure it has a full clip and nod. You all sit silently and listen to Neil in the other room. ""Please help me,"" you hear him beg. ""I can't find you guys.""\n\nThis goes on for 20 whole minutes, Neil's acting growing steadily worse.

In steps the monster, mouth stained with blood, eyes looking about wildly.\n\nIt takes a step toward you.\n\n""Over here, motherfucker!"" Meat shouts through his suit's comm.\n\nIt growls and moves toward him. Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall.

You fire.\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he's behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n""Hold on!""\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they're pulled as well. A moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster's fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm. You can't help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n""We did it,"" Meat says.

Everyone, including you, buys each other rounds until you're all bloated and sick and green.\n\nOutside, you vomit in the street while you wait for a cab.\n\n""I'll...I'll get my car later,"" Meat says.\n\nSomehow you all manage to tell the cabbie your respective addresses. You stumble out of the cab at your house and tell the others you'll call them later.\n\n""Bionic woman!"" Neil shrieks as the cab takes off.\n\nYour house, it turns out, looks the same as it did before you left on your mission. You take two steps into the living room and fall onto the couch. You grip the cushions with your fingers and, face pressed into them, laugh.\n\nYou are home. You are alive and you are home. You wake up the next morning, mouth dry and head pounding. You take a shower and then call that doctor.\n\n""Jessica,"" she tells you. ""That's my name.""\n\nYou ask her out for coffee. You meet her at a coffee shop and both you order terrible tasting drinks. It's clear you both like each other. She invites you back to her place, a nice apartment with windows that face the belly of the Valles Marineris. You make love; it's nice.\n\nSoon you're dating. You agree to an open relationship but, within a month, you're dating exclusively.\n\nThe outpost in New Ausin has given you an analyst position. While you resent the military's decision that your disability keeps you from being combat ready, part of you is relieved to be away from danger (the raise is nice, too).\n\nYour life is quiet, peaceful. You still meet up with Salvucci, Neil, and Meat from time to time at the bar. They like Jessica, though Neil is a bit too flirty with you for Jessica's liking.\n\nOne night Meat takes you aside. ""They're nuking earth.""\n\n1.[[""They're doing what?""]]\n\n"
"Awaken.","Meat's there when you wake up. You're lying under a sheet on the examination table in sickbay and can't move.""\n\n""Goddamn, you're lucky Salvucci was a medic back in the day.""\n\n1.[[""Where's Markie?""]]"

"Blast the little bastards.","You both retreat. ""Neil,"" Meat yells over the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" you hear the pilot say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You surge ahead of Markie and lose feeling in your legs, but somehow you keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you eventually stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way you see Meat running. Ryan is nowhere to be found. You've covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you watch her fling one of the crab creatures across the ground.\n\n""Fuck!"" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces. The two of you rush over to her. She's holding her arm.\n\n""It got me,"" she says; there's fear in her voice. She turns to Meat. ""Where's Ryan?""\n\n""Goddamn fucking thing ate him. It ATE him.""\n\nMeat's answer fills you with dread. No one that close to you has ever died before. Your vision becomes unfocused. A slap on the arm brings you back.\n\n""We've got company, Zoe. I need you here and now,"" Meat says, nodding at the mouth of the cave where the crab creatures are gathering. There must be thousands of them. Luckily, behind you, you hear the Speedwell land.\n\nMeat fires several shots at the crabs, but they don't seem to be leaving the cave anyway.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship's elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you, his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster. He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there's no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where's she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie's drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it's just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What the hell is she saying?""]]\n"

"Go to the cockpit.","You and Meat follow the captain to cockpit. Neil, the ship's pilot, sits at the controls.

Don't like it whatever it is.""\nThe whine again. You focus your eyes and see something moving in the dark.\n\nMeat sees it, too. He fires at it. As muzzle fire fills the cave with flashes of light you see that the creature isn't one thing: but many things, with feelers and sharp teeth.\n\nThey rush toward you, hundreds of them.\n\n""Let's get out of here,"" Meat yells.\n\n1.

"Follow Meat and Neil.","""Everyone keep your wits about you, and let's meet back here in an hour. You guys see if you can shut down that racket.""\n\nThe captain bends down and grabs something from the floor and tosses it in your direction. You barely catch the object: it's a walke-talkie. \n\n""If you run into it, let us know.""\n\nWhen all of you get to where the hallways branch off, your group goes to the left. You take one last look at Strauss and Salvucci before they disappear around the bend. The walkie-talkie feels heavy hanging from your belt clip. \n\n""Scarborough Fair"" plays loudly as the three of you carefully walk down the hallway. Meat has his assault rifle out, pointed dead ahead. Every now and then he'll look to each side, though the hallway is really too narrow for anything else to fit alongside the rest of you.\n\nParsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme\nRemember me to the one who lives there...\n\n""You've got a weird taste in music, Neil.""\n\n""Don't knock Lani Hall, dude.""\n\n""Why do you think it's fucking with the music anyway?""\n\n1.[[""It's trying to scare us.""]]\n2.[[""It's covering its own noises.""]]"
"Shoot the window.","You unload your clip into the window. On the fourth shot you hear a sucking sound. \n\nBingo.\n\nThe doctor leaps back behind the door. You smash the button and the emergency door comes down between you and the beast. It wastes no time in striking at the door with its tentacles. You watch through the glass in the door as the viewport's glass cracks, shatters, and is sucked into space. The beast, though it tries to cling to the inside of the ship with its appendages, is sucked out shortly after.\n\n""We did it,"" Strauss says, relieved. The alarms blare for a few minutes until the emergency panel comes down and covers where the viewport was.\n\nThe door in front of you lifts, giving you access to the rest of the ship again.\n\n""I guess we should burn the other bodies. Just to be sure. I'll go to the lab and make some molotovs. You go get our cryopods ready.""\n\n1. [[Initiate you and Strauss' cryopods.]]\n\n"

"""Not great.""","He sighs. ""Figured as much.""\n\nThe PA clicks on: ""All officers report to sickbay,"" Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his bowl and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you're out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nYou and Meat exchange no words on the way to sickbay. The door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube. She's looking around wildly.\n\nYou smell gunsmoke. Ben has both of his hands wrapped around his pistol.\n\n1.[[""What happened?""]]\n\n\n\n"
"""What's she saying?""","""Complete gibbersh, sounds like,"" Lenore says with cold detachment. ""Move."" \n\nShe scoots past you and turns on the device in her hand. A hot laser point darts out about three inches from the top port of the device. Another line escapes the bottom port and swings upward to connect to the top beam.\n\n""Cauterizing saw,"" she explains. ""You might want to leave this to the professionals, girlie.

You're the tiniest one—the easiest prey, see?""\n\n""You're not making this any more appealing.""\n\n""We can't make him do this,"" Strauss interjects, finally saying something.\n\n""When the fuck did you grow a conscience? ""Meat growls.\n\n""I did what I did for the sake of survival. There were no other options. There are other options here. We just need to think rationally.""\n\n""Well,"" Meat says.

"""Aye.""","Both groups go in a separate directions; you hike down the cliff with Ryan. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel. You step inside.\n\n""Flashlights,"" Ryan says.

You do the same.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head Up Display (HUD) of your helmet you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad.

She walks out the door and starts running, screaming her head off.\n\n""Five minutes,""  Salvucci says. ""That's all we give her.""\n\nMeat nods. Her footsteps (and screams) trail away.\n\nAfter three minutes Salvucci says ""She's had enough time. Let's go.""\n\nThe three of you run down the hall to sickbay. She's inside, screwing a hose onto a black machine of some sort. She looks up. ""I told you to give me mor--""\n\nShe's interrupted by Markie's descent from the ventilation shaft onto the examination table. She growls at all of you. A giant purple claw has sprouted out of her missing arm. The other arm is rotting, like the rest of her body.\n\n""Prettyprettyprettypretty.""\n\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see the cauterizing saw on the table next to the bed. \n\n1.[[Attack with the saw.]]\n2.[[Attack with your gun.]]"

[[Go to sleep.]]\n"
"Search for Neil.","You take Meat's pistol and proceed down the hall until you reach the cockpit. The door is unlocked. You step through.\n\nBoth Neil and Salvucci are there peering over the main console. They turn when they hear you enter.\n\n""Julia?"" Neil says, his eyes staring at the blood on your uniform.\n\n1.

Meat knocks on the door.\n\nFrom within: ""Password?""\n\n""Come on, Neil. Knock that shit off.""\n\nAgain, louder: ""Password?""\n\nMeat sighs. ""Ocelot.""\n\nThe door slides open, and Neil's boyish face is there to greet you. ""Heard gunshots. You guys killin' things out here?""\n\nSalvucci cuts to the chase. ""Doctor Strauss, Ben, and Markie are dead. Whatever killed them is still on the ship, dressed in Markie's skin.""\n\nNeil looks at you all from left to right. ""You guys are fucking with me, right?""\n\n""Does it look like we're yanking your chain, Neil?"" Meat growls, pointing to his gore-covered boot.\n\nHe gulps. ""No, I guess not.

"Go to sleep","It's as though no time passes between the moment the darkness falls over you to when you open your eyes again and see ten soldiers standing over you, peering down, each of them equipped with assault rifles.\n\n""Come on, lieutenant,"" one of them says, lifting you to your feet. You see Meat being held up by two soldiers. He's grinning like a fool.\n\n""We did it,"" his eyes say.\n\nThe troops escort you both to your own personal rooms where you're served cheap steak and soda pop. It all tastes superb.\n\nLater, you and Meat are interviewed about the incident aboard the Speedwell. Security footage corroborates your testimonies. \n\nYou stay in your room for a week, feeling shackled and hoping that the military doesn't eliminate you because of secrets you shouldn't know. You and Meat are then taken to meet a general and his staff. You tell them your story. The old man nods and thanks you for your bravery.\n\nAnother day goes by and then, finally, you are released by the staff into the world. The familiar cityscape of New Austin is a welcome sight.\n\n""What now?"" Meat asks, turning to you.\n\n1.[[""Get a drink.""]]\n2.[[Go home.]]\n\n"

It's not right at all.""\n\n""Just give me your damn gun, dude."" He coughs. Meat, with reluctance, takes the pistol from his holster and sticks it in Neil's hand. He then goes from stove to stove, turning on the gas.\n\nAnother bang at the door. The tip of a tentacle pierces the door and writhes wildly about, slapping a nearby wall.\n\n""Go,"" Neil says, fighting to stay conscious.\n\n1.[[""God damn it. I'm so sorry, Neil.""]]\n2. [[Say nothing to him.]]\n"
"Get drinks with Meat.","""I hear that!""\n\nThe two of you travel by cab to the nearest bar and order your weight in whiskey shots. You laugh as you reminisce about good times with the crew, then you cry as you mourn the tragedy of their deaths. And then comes the silence where you both sit, staring at the table, saying nothing, just drinking as you come to grips with the fact that you're both alive.\n\n""I should get home,"" Meat says. ""Rhonda's waiting. Give me a call if you need anything, okay?""\n\n1.[[""You do as well.""]]"
"""Where on the ship did you look?""","""Everywhere,"" Meat says before swallowing a chip. ""Engineering, the cafeteria, the cryo room. We checked every nook and cranny. My only guess is that they're in the vents.""\n\n""This is some fucked up shit,"" Neil says.\n\n""Eloquent as always, pilot,"" Strauss snaps.\n\n""We should move shop,"" Meat says after a moment. ""This facility has two doors. I don't like that. Captain and I were talking; the common room is more safe and it's closer to the cafeteria. We can make supply runs.""\n\n""...while we—what? Wait for the creature to die?"" Strauss asks.\n\n""That's the plan. We stay safe, let it starve.""\n\n""And what if it can wait longer than us? What if that's part of the thing's plan? Wait till we get sick and hungry enough for it to overpower us. Did you even bother thinking about the logistics of that move? Cryosleep is part of the ship's travel. We don't have enough food on board to support us until we reach earth. We have maybe a month at the most before we run out. Then what?""\n\n""I don't know, okay? I hear a lot of criticism but I don't hear you contributing anything else, doctor.""\n\nStrauss scowled. ""That's because I'm trying to prevent you from leading us into a disaster.""\n\n""Can it, the both of you,"" Salvucci commands. ""Travis is right as far as safety precautions go. The common room will be easier to forify and protect than this place. We can worry about long term plans once we get set up there.

"""Could be Ben.""","""Even better,"" Meat says grimly.\n\n""Let's just shut down the computer,"" Neil says.\n\n""It's your computer. After you, your majesty.""\n\n""Oh no, you've got the gun. You go first. Please, I insist.""\n\nMeat grumbles as he steps past Neil and peers into the room. You see him flip on the light attached to the rifle.\n\n""See anything?""\n\n""No, but it's dark. There's shattered glass on the floor—probably the lights."" He creeps into the room slowly. \n\nYou and Neil follow.\n\nRemember me to the one who lives there...\n \nThe room is pitch black except for the light coming from the computer terminal next to Neil's bed. The computer, a custom built powerhouse, sits on the floor and is connected to an obnoxiously large, wall-mounted flat screen. On the screen, you see a music library. Meat flashes his light across the floor. There's at least 11 or 12 footsteps separating you and the terminal, a no-man's land of shattered glass and possible traps.\n\n""Well,"" Neil says after a moment. ""I guess one of us should cross—""\n\nGunfire cuts Neil's sentence off as Meat fires three rounds into the terminal. The music dies abruptly.\n\n""Are you fucking kidding me?!""  Neil erupts. ""That was two months worth of pay! It was like, the ultimate fucking entertainment system, dude.""\n\nYou can't make out Meat's expression in the dark but you can tell he's not in the mood to deal with Neil's shit. ""Listen, if we get out of this alive, I'll buy you a new toy, okay?""\n\n""It was brand new!""\n\n""Shut up. Did you hear that?""\n\nYou listen. You hear nothing, not the crackling of glass, or an insidious snicker. Nada.\n\n""Let's go,"" says Meat. You all turn, and, of course, there she is, standing next to the door.\n\nNeil gasps in horror. Markie smiles at all of you, the hallway light shining on her face to reveal rotting flesh and a dangling eyeball. Her arm stump oozes yellow.\n\nMeat raises his rifle, but he's too slow. She slams the door.\nYou're locked in here with her.\n\n1. [[Fire your pistol blindly.]]\n2. [[Run. Like. Hell.]]\n"

""Guys, we're not alone,"" Markie says into her comm.\n\n""What's that?"" you hear Ryan say over your comm.\n\n""There's something in here with us.""\n\nShe nods at you and you both slowly back away. You pull out your weapon.\n\n""What is it?"" Meat asks.\n\n""No idea. Whatever it is, we're in its territory. I'm inclined to think we should leave it alone. Let's head back to the ship.""\n\nThe whine again. You focus your eyes and see something moving in the dark.\n\nMarkie sees it as well.""There's too many of them. Fall back!""\n\nShe fires a single shot. The flash of light reveals that the creature isn't one thing, but many things, with feelers and sharp teeth.\n\nThey rush toward you, hundreds of them.\n\n1.

Salvucci, Strauss, and Neil are there as well, wearing their uniforms.\n\n1.[[""Everyone okay?""]]\n2. [[Wait for someone to say something.]]\n"
"""We could just knock you out.""","""That's a joke, right? You're joking.""\n\nMeat slaps Neil on the shoulder. ""We won't let you get eaten. You gotta do this.

I think all you're going find is dirt down there,"" Markie replies.\n\n""Don't forget the radiation,"" Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n""That too.""\n\nMarkie peers down. ""Zoom,"" she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n""You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?"" Ryan teases Meat. ""I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y'know? Girls go for that sort of thing.""\n\nMeat grunts. ""Not my woman.

As long as we stick together, we won't lose anymore people.""\n\nThe four of you decide to stick it out in the mess hall. Meat, you, and Salvucci take turns keeping an eye on the door for Markie. Strauss rations the food that comes out of the pantry...including your soy cookies. You try not to hold it against her.\n\nA week passes. No sign of the creature yet.\n\n""Nice beard you've got going on there, Neil,"" Meat tells the pilot, who's been cultivating uneven patches of facial hair.\n\n""Bite me, big man.""\n\nYou're in the middle of biting into the last half of your final soy cookie when you hear the sound in the vent--something squishy.\n\n""You heard it too?"" Meat says, standing up and pointing his rifle at the vent.\n\nSomething starts to hammer at the vent cover.\n\n""It's her!"" Salvucci yells. ""Fire!""\n\nThe three of you unload your clips into the vent. The destroyed cover falls to the floor. And then something else: A giant, bulbous, leaky sack that explodes when it hits the ground. Blood and pus fly everywhere. \n\nYou black out.\n\nWhen you come to, Meat's helping you up. He, like you and everyone else, is covered in gore.\n\n""Everyone alright?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n""Yeah, ugh this is so nast--"" Meat is interrupted by Strauss leaning over and vomiting on the floor.\n\n""Couldn't have said it better myself, doc. What was that? A bomb?""\n\n""It's...oh god,"" Strauss spits. ""It's what left of her.""  She points at something on the ground.\n\n1. [[Look where she's pointing.]]\n"

Halfway there he stumbles and nearly falls. ""I'm okay!"" he says. ""I'm okay.""\n\nIn the cockpit, Neil nearly trips when he gets to the console, curses; he turns to you and his face pales.\n\n""You're bleeding...from your eyes.""\n\nYou feel the wetness on your cheek. You put a finger to the wetness and come away with a red smattering. You look at Neil and see that he's bleeding from his nose. After a second, he notices too.\n\n""I guess we're both infected now. Shit.""\n\n1. [[""Fuck. Guess the old man was right.""]]"
"Shoot her.","You shoot her in the face. Her corpse falls back onto the floor and is still.\n\nMoments later both Neil and Salvucci burst through the door. Salvucci's gun is in his hand.

Just ready for this to all be over.""\n\n""Well, let's get on our way then.""\n\nYou get in your pod and lay down. ""Sweet dreams everyone,"" you hear Meat say right before your chamber shuts itself. \n\nSoon it's dark. You close your eyes. The world gets even darker.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, Meat, and Strauss are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nMen in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, Salvucci, and Strauss meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in merriment, celebrating your survival, though you allow yourselves to mournfully drink a round and say small eulogies for the dead: Ben, Markie, Neil, Ryan.\n\nWhen you're all finished, you share a cab that drops you off at your respective addresses. You're the first. Your comrades tell you to call them soon just to check in. Inside your small house in the suburbs, you finally allow yourself a good cry. Not for the dead. Not for any reason at all, in particular, except that it's been inside you for so long, struggling to get out.\n\nA week passes. You're relocated to an analyst position on the military base. You hear that Strauss is working at a research facility in New Memphis. You never talk to her, really, but Salvucci and Meat send you emails all the time. Both of them have been reassigned to on-base positions; Meat's an instructor, and Salvucci can't tell you what he does. You imagine it has something to do with what you found on earth.\n\nYears pass. You never marry or have children, but you're never alone. Boys come and go, at a rate of about one every five years. You become attached to them all and break down in sobs when each one leaves. You never tell any of your lovers about your experience aboard the Speedwell.\n\nYou and Meat become close. You meet twice a week for lunch. On Wednesdays, you watch sitcoms; on Fridays, there's salsa night downtown. You get a dog. This is your existence and it proceeds one day after another.\n\nYou grow old; it's inevitable. Salvucci dies first. You and Meat attend his funeral. You both take bets on who's next; turns out it's you.\n\nYou pass away one night in your sleep, your dog curled up behind you with his snout against your back, the hound peacefully unaware of your endless slumber.\n\nThe End\n"
"Save yourself; leave him to die.","It's a hard choice, but in the end, you get to your feet and sprint past the monster as it slaughters Meat. You can hear his screams as you run down the hall. Soon things are mercifully silent. \n\nYou climb up into the ventilation and decide to make your base of operations there. You're a survivor, you tell yourself. All you have to do is stay alive two months. That's all.\n\nYou go, day by day, into the ship in search of supplies. You often go to the mess hall to stock up on food and bring it back to the vents. You run into creature twice. Each time it's grown bigger, nastier. The first time, you get away without a scratch.\n\nThe second time, a tentacle pierces your ankle. You still manage to hop away, but you can't climb into the vent because of your injury. You seek refuge in the darkness of the barracks. Soon every breath brings pain. You refuse to accept the hand you've been dealt, even when Strauss, a bullet hole in her forehead, sits down beside you to have a chat.\n\n""You had a good run, idiot,"" she says. \n\n1.[[""You aren't real.""]]"

"Get out of there.","You both retreat. ""Neil,"" he yells into the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You've covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n""Markie,"" Meat says, ""where's Ryan?""\n\nShe stutters. ""D...d..dead.""\n\n""Fuck!"" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie. Her arm is wounded.\n\n1.[[""You alright?""]]\n2.[[Stay silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.]]"
"You go to the mess hall for a bite to eat.","The mess hall is rather small: two tables next to an enclosed kitchen. You find Meat sitting by himself, shoveling ramen into his mouth. A plastic cup filled with cheap whiskey is next to his arm. You grab your favorite snack, a box of soy oatmeal cookies, and take a seat.\n\nMeat looks up at you, eyes red, a weary expression.\n\n""Hell of a day, huh? Poor Ryan. How's Markie?""\n\n1.[[""Strauss is removing her arm.""]]\n2.[[""Not great.""]]\n\n\n"
"""He didn't.""","""Shit. We can't set this to autopilot or send out a distress beacon without access to that console.""\n\n""What's the trouble, cap?""

Do you know it?""\n\nMeat shakes his head.\n\n""Okay, what did we know about him?""\n\n""He liked video games,"" Meat offers, approaching the console.\n\nSalvucci slowly inputs ""FLAPPY BIRD XXXXXI.""\n\nACCESS DENIED, the screen reads.\n\n""Worth a shot.""\n\nYou all spend an hour typing various game titles, but none of them work. Eventually you give up and retire to the mess hall where Salvucci cooks hamburger meat for you both. \n\nYou eat quietly.\n\nThe next day you all try again with various game titles to no avail. \n\n""To think everything hinges on a goddamn video game,"" Meat says.\n\nFor days it goes like this, your ship still drifting in space. Eventually you run out of food. You all try for hours in desperation to magically conjure up the password, but it's no good. The three of you realize that at that point you're just making up titles that sound like video games: Masher Nasher, The Adventures of Wallaby Dingo.\n\nYou all make your way to the mess hall and sit quietly, removed from one another. You think of your home back on Mars. You're glad you didn't get a pet. You wonder if anyone besides your parents will mourn your passing. Will they ever even know? You stare out one of the hall's viewports into space, your grave. There are worse ways to die, you say to yourself, than floating among the stars. \n\nIt's hardly a comfort for you in the days to come. Eventually Salvucci takes his life, a gunshot ringing out on the far side of the ship, away from the mess hall, away from you and Meat.\n\n""You know,"" Meat says one day. ""I thought about eating you.""\n\n1.[[""Why didn't you?""]]\n2.[[""Not much to eat.""]]\n"
"Keep on going toward the mess hall.","""See,"" Meat says. ""Zoe says he'll be fine too. He's a big boy.""\n\nThe four of you make your way to the mess hall. \n\n""Check everything,"" Salvucci orders. You look around the tables and near the entertainment closest while Meat looks around the kitchen. Salvucci keeps his eyes on the door. Strauss sits at a table away from everyone.\n\nYou find a small bag of chips and pocket them. No monsters, though.\n\nMeat pokes his head out of the kitchen. ""Nothing."" He looks at all of you and shrugs his shoulders. ""What now?""\n\nAs if to answer him, a loud shriek erupts from the vent hanging over you all.\n\n""A GIFFTTTTT,"" Markie screams from the vent.\n\n""Oh god,"" Strauss says, backing into the wall.\n\n""Kill it,"" Salvucci says, raising his pistol. You, Meat, and Salvucci fire into the vent.\n\n""Don't waste your ammo. Just a few shots,"" Meat yells.\n\nYou fire half of your clip and lower your weapon. The vent cover drops to the floor. Meat and Salvucci lower their guns as well.\n\n""We got her, right?"" Meat says.\n\n""agiftagiftagiftagift,"" Markie answers from the vent.\n\n""Fuck me.""\n\n""agiftagiftagiftAGIFTAGIFTAGIFT,"" she screams. At first, you're not sure what falls from the vent.You see a small, almost circular object dropping through the air. When it hits the ground with a splat, you know what it is, but you can't bring yourself to look.\n\nStrauss' screams confirm your fears. You finally look down; it's Neil's head. Both his eyes have been gouged out and there's a jagged line of flesh and muscle where he was decapitated.\n\n""A GIFT!"" Markie yells once more before you hear her scamper away further into the ducts.\n\n""I told you,"" Strauss, the first to speak, says. ""We should have sent someone to look after him.\n\nMeat kicks over a table.\n\n""I told you!"" Strauss screams at him.\n\n""Doctor, quiet,"" Salvucci barks. He lowers his voice. ""We'll mourn later.""\n\n""If we fucking live that long,"" Meat says.\n\n""We have to trap it,"" Strauss says suddenly.\n\n""Go on, doctor,"" says Salvucci, still eyeing Neil's head.\n\n""I think it's pretty clear bullets aren't effective. We need to either space her or trap her in a tightly contained space and burn her.""\n\n""Risky options,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""For once, I'm in agreement with the good doctor.

Ben's body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n""Well, that's good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You step into the cockpit. The door slides shut behind you.\n\n""Here's the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you.

Looking up, you see the thing step into view: it's monstrous, with a muscular human abdomen. The thing's face is distinctly unhuman with countless, slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster's mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattle snake.\n\nYou turn to look at Meat. He's being lifted into the air by one of the tentacles. His face turns red; he's slowly being choked to death.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Save Meat's life.]]\n2.

"Run. Now.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n""What are you doing? Run!""\n\nYou both retreat. ""Neil,"" Meat yells over the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You surge ahead of Markie and lose feeling in your legs, but somehow you keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but eventually you stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Meat running. Ryan is nowhere to be found. You've covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you watch her fling one of the crab creatures across the ground.\n\n""Fuck!"" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces.The two of you rush over to her. She's holding her arm.\n\n""It got me,"" she says; you detect fear in her voice. She turns to Meat.\n\n""Where's Ryan?""\n\n""Goddamn fucking thing ate him. It ATE him.""\n\nMeat's answer fills you with dread. No one that close to you has ever died before. Your vision becomes unfocused. A slap on the arm brings you back.\n\n""We've got company, Zoe. I need you here and now,"" Meat says, nodding at the mouth of the cave where the crab creatures are gathering. There must be thousands of them. Luckily, behind you, you hear the Speedwell land.\n\nMeat fires several shots at the crabs, but they don't seem to be leaving the cave anyway.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship's elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you—-his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster. He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there's no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where's she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit. You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie's drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it's just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What the hell is she saying?""]]"
"""I'm fine. Stop asking.""","He looks away sheepishly. ""Sorry.""\n\n""Stop trying to hit that, Ryan. It's not gonna happen,"" says Markie, the Speedwell's science officer.\n\nRyan waves his hands dismissively. The enforcer of the group, Meat, chuckles. ""She told you.""\n\n1.

"Eat him.","You take your knife and slowly cut up Meat's body. It's messy work, dividing the flesh and muscle from the bone. You store the body in various bags that are then stuffed into the freezer.\n\nYou stay alive another week, but the ships never come. The will to live finally leaves you; you lay down on the floor and close your eyes. You would cry if you had the strength.\n\nThe last thing you feel is the cold of the metal floor leaving your cheek.\n\nThe End\n\n"
"""It was tempting.""","""Right? She's awful. No doubt about it.""\n\nThe two of you enter the cafeteria and then, after taking a precautionary look around, you go into the kitchen and begin to stuff everything you can get your hands on into the two bags you brought from sickbay: fruit chips, soda, water bottles, pastries, canned soup.\n\nWhen you've filled the bags, you leave the cafeteria and make your way to the common room. Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n""Run into any trouble?"" Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n""Didn't see a damn thing,"" Meat says.\n\n""I'm telling you,"" Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, ""we won't see it until it wants us to see it.""\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n""How's your arm, doctor?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n""Fine, captain. Thank you.""\n\nYou feel tired.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\n1. [[Talk to Meat and Neil]]\n2. [[Go to sleep.]]\n"
"""Nothing to be done about it, I guess.""","He shrugs his shoulders. ""I guess so.""\n\nYou both return to your group of friends to find that Neil is mooning the barkeep.\n\nWeeks pass. One day you see a report about Earth destructing. ""An issue with the core,"" says the handsome anchor. No one mentions monsters. No mentions nukes or fleets of war crusiers. It stirkes you that no one will ever know the sacrifices of you or your crew. You weep and Jessica asks what's wrong.\n\nYou lie. Just as you do when she asks you about the augmentations--the very ones she installed. ""Accident in the cryotube,"" you tell her. You're so wracked with guilt over these lies that you make it a priority to never lie to her about anything. For the most part, your relationship is one built on trust.\n\nThree years after your return to Mars you're married. It's a simple ceremony. Your parents show up, as do the surviving members of your crew. You eat cake. You kiss.\n\nYou move in with Jessica even though her apartment is smaller than yours. You just love the view of the Martian landscape and Jessica, quite content not to move anything, is more than happy to oblige you.\n\nOne day you catch a glimpse of light reflecting off the glass window of the balcony. You step onto the balcony and look out across the red canyons of your planet just to take in the beauty of it all. This is your new life, you tell youself. You've earned every second of it.\n             \nThe End\n\n"
"""I'm so sorry, Neil.""","You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I'll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nYou look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Meat, he's already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. \n\n1. [[Put your hand on his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Don't.]]"

This is your new life, you tell youself. It's one you've made for yourself, and you've earned every second of it.\n             \nThe End\n\n"
"""We should check on Neil.""","Salvucci nods. ""That's a good idea.  You take doctor Strauss and do that. Travis and I will go check engineering. If it's wounded and looking for some place to hide, there's plenty of spots. Let's meet back here in an hour.""\n\nStrauss scoffs. ""You're treating the beast like it's a wounded animal. You're wrong. It showed no hesitation when it attacked. It's not afraid of us. It's waiting.""\n\nSalvucci wrinkles his nose as he is wont to do when someone said something that annoyed him. ""Regardless, we'll find the creature and put it down.""\n\n""Creatures,"" she says, correcting him. ""There might be two of them now.""\n\n""Noted,"" Meat says, replacing the clip in his rifle.  You realize now that he has the most powerful firearm on the ship.\n\n""If you two run into it or them or whatever, don't try to fight. Just run.

Strauss replies before leaving the room. \n\nYou follow.\n\n""Julia,"" Meat calls right before you step into the hallway. You turn. ""Be careful.""\n\nStrauss is waiting for you when you step outside. She's holding her arm. There's a patch of red coming through the white sleeve right above the elbow.\n\n""It's not a bite,"" she says, noticing your stare.

""I don't have a walkie.""\n\n""Run,"" she says.\n\nAnd you do. As fast as you can. Inside sickbay, you find Meat, sitting down on the floor, staring at where the bodies should be, but instead there's only a lot of blood and some meaty chunks.\n\nAn oil can, a bottle, and a rag are next to him.\n\n""Where are they?""  Strauss demands. ""The bodies? Where are they?""\n\n""Oh good. You're alive,"" Meat says. You can feel the force of his eyeroll from here.\n\n""Where are the bodies? Did you burn them?""\n\n""No, doctor. As you would have gathered from the lack of smoke if you weren't a nutjob, I have not burned a damn thing. I came back and they were gone.""\n\nStrauss approaches Meat, gets in his face. ""Well did they just fucking get up and walk off?""\n\nHe yells back. ""I don't know! You're supposed to be the doctor here.""\n\n""Everyone relax,"" Salvucci says, voice raised.  Meat and Strauss calm down, each refusing to look at the other, each saying nothing.\n\n""We've got two missing bodies, possibly infected and mutated into hostile lifeforms.""

"""No.""","""So you're just as lonely and pathetic as I am. Well, misery, company and all that, I suppose.""\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit.

"""Probably to put us on edge.""","""Well, we're about to put an end to that shit,"" Meat says as you approach the crew's quarters.

Fuck!""\n\n""What is it?"" Meat barks.\n\n""Nothing,"" Neil says, regaining his composure. ""Just fucking slime. Oh god, gag a maggot,"" he says. ""This shit reeks."" He holds his hand up to the light to reveal a goopy, transparent liquid.\n\n""Hey, that looks a little bit like—""\n\n""Don't you fucking say it, Travis.""\n\nYou examine the cables without touching them.\n\nMeat takes a look as well. ""Seems like a complicated operation.""\n\n""What, turning on the computer, starting a program, and plugging in some cables?""\n\nMeat turns. ""You didn't see how feral this thing was—not to mention she's missing a goddamn arm.""\n\n1.[[""It might be Ben.""]]\n"
"Use the saw.","You reach and grab the saw. Markie's about to leap atop you when you swing the heated blades into her right foot, removing it from the rest of her body. She topples back as the leg stump turns into a geyesr of black blood. You throw the saw at her face, blinding her with heat.\n\n""Put her in the chamber!"" Strauss roars, pointing with her free hand at the cryochamber in the corner of the room. Meat and the captain are quick, grabbing the creature while it flails about. They pull it by the rotting arm to the chamber quickly. The pod hisses as it opens. Markie snaps at them, tries to attack with her claw but she can't get a shot in. She shrieks as Meat and Salvucci heave her into the pod.\n\nYou smash the control panel with your fist and the chamber closes. You can hear Markie's muffeled screams from within. She starts to smack the door with her claw; cracks appear in the glass.\n\n""Whatever you're doing do it fast, doc."" Meat says, aiming his rifle at the pod.\n\n""Put your gun down and take this,"" she says, passing off the hose from the machine. Meat takes it. ""Now, plug it into the port at the bottom of the pod. Hurry! And make sure it's plugged in tight.""\n\nAnother crack in the glass. Meat takes the hose and screws it into the pod's port.\n\n""Let go!""\n\nMeat backs away from the metal hose. Strauss presses several buttons on the machine.\n\n""What is that?"" Salvucci says.\n\n""It's the incinerator,"" she says, slamming her palm down on one last button. You hear the roar of the flames as they pass through the hose and into the chamber itself.The inside of the pod lights up as Markie's screams become even louder. \n\nIt beats against the glass harder with her claw, but it's useless. Within minutes the monster's been vaporized.\n\nFor a moment, no one says anything. And then, just as you're all about to take a breath, in stumbles what was once Ben. The creature, missing both its eyeballs, gurgles as it reaches out toward you with rotting hands.\n\n1. [[Shoot Ben.]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

"Take the shot anyway.","You squeeze the trigger. Neil's head swings right in front of the barrel when you do. His head pops.

"Shoot the beast.","You fire your last shot in the dark.

The squad vital monitor shrieks at you.\n\nYou flee.\n\nLooking over your shoulder, you watch as what's left of Ryan is pulled out of sight.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie. Behind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the sand. You run toward your squadmates.  You've covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach them, Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fires several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie's arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your empty pistol and bash the monster's dome inward. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived, as Meat puts three rounds into the soft underbelly.\n\n""Fucking fuck.""

In steps the monster, mouth stained with blood, eyes looking about wildly.\n\nIt takes a step toward you.\n\n""Over here, motherfucker!"" Meat shouts through his suit's comm.\n\nIt growls and moves toward Meat. Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall. He grabs onto a wall-railing.\n\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n""Do it, do it now.""\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he's behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n""Hold on!""\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they're pulled as well.  \n\nA moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster's fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm. You can't help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n""We did it,"" Meat says.

"""Of course. You too.""","He smiles. The cab pulls away and you walk past your box—you'll get the mail later—and inside your home.\n\nThe door slides shut. And that's when you fall apart. You crumble to the floor and bawl yourself to sleep. You wake hours later only to cry yourself asleep again.\n\nWhen you wake up again, you want to believe it's a new day but you can still feel the weight of the dead on your shoulders. It's a weight you never learn to completely shake, but you grow accustomed to it: the night terrors, the sudden flashes of Neil's sacrifice.\n\nMeat's friendship and an ungodly amount of therapy helps you get through the trauma, as does Jack, the man who becomes your husband. The military sticks you with an analyst position, something you're quite fine with, though it is boring work.\n\nYou grow older. You and Jack talk about having kids.\n\n1. [[You have kids.]]\n2. [[You don't have kids.]]\n\n\n"
"""I get that vibe, too.""","""I tell you; I don't even think she qualifies as a human.""\n\nThe intercom clicks on before you can say anything. ""All officers report to sickbay,"" Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his bowl and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you're out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nYou and Meat exchange no words on the way to sickbay. The door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube. She's looking around wildly.\n\nYou smell gunsmoke. Ben has both of his hands wrapped around his pistol.\n\n1.[[""What happened?""]]\n\n\n"
"""Get out of the way!""","Before the words can leave your mouth, there's a whooshing sound, followed by a giant spike tearing through Ryan's chest, splattering the cave with red. Ryan's pistol drops to the floor. He moans. \n\nYou cast your light on the protruding spike and realize, as your comrade is slowly being lifted in the air, that it's a limb of some sort.\n\nMarkie's voice barks over the comm. ""Zoe! What's happening!? Ryan's vitals are dropping."" You fire several shots into the darkness. One of them slaps into Ryan's arm; his blue eyes gaze at you in shock.\n\nMeat now: ""Zoe? Answer us, girl. What the fuck is going on?""\n\n1.[[""We need to go. Now!""]]\n2.[[""Ryan's chum.""]]\n\n"
"""Strauss is removing her arm.""","Meat makes a face. ""Fucking nazi. It's a tiny bite. Can't they just disinfect it? It was bad enough losing somebody; we don't have to maim her.""\n\n1.[[""It might be for the best.""]]\n2.[[""Yeah. It's bullshit.""]]\n"
"Give Meat a chance to explain.","""He might come back, y'know?"" Meat says. ""Like a zombie.""\n\n""Stop talking,"" Salvucci says. ""We need to find Strauss.""\n\n""If she isn't dead,"" Meat says grimly, eyes set on what's left of Ben's face.\n\n1.[[""He said Markie chased her into the hall.""]]\n2.[[""Ben said Markie chased her into the hallway. She's probably dead.""]]"
"Don't say anything to him.","Neil nods at you one last time. You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I'll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nYou look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Meat, he's already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. \n\n1. [[Put your hand on his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Don't.]]"
"""I wish.""","""You look better. Neil's already at the bar. Salvucci will be along soon.""\n\nSure enough, the little man is already getting his drink on when you step through the door.\n\n""Holyyyy shit,"" he says, the margarita he just sipped through his straw spraying everywhere. ""It's the bionic woman! Barkeep! I'm buying all this lady's drinks tonight.""\n\nYou take a seat next to him at the table. Meat sits next to you and nearly takes up your whole side of the booth.\n\nYou turn to Neil, who's bright red in the face.\n\n1.[[""What, no foam finger for me?""]]"
"End Strauss' pain.","You fire a single shot. Strauss' head goes back and her limbs go limp. Markie turns to see all of you. She growls and drops Strauss.\n\nThat's when Meat fires at the control panel. Upon impact, the door dividing the hanger from the rest of the ship comes down, seperating you from the hanger. Alarms blare. You watch from the door's window as both Strauss' corpse and the creature are sucked out into space. You watch the two forms drift away until they're dots, inseparable from distant stars.\n\nNone of you give a cheer or breathe a sigh of relief, however. There's a sense of shame that hangs over all of you, an awareness of your cowardice. You played it safe so that one of your crewmates could sacrafice herself.\n\nThe auto-close kicks in and the hanger door shuts itself. The alarms cease their cries.\n\n""We should go check Neil's console,"" Meat says.\n\nThe three of you silently make your way to the cockpit. Inside, you find the autopilot already engaged. The console is covered in blood; the pilot's corpse is behind it.\n\n""He knew he wasn't going to make it,"" Meat says bitterly. \n""Setting the autopilot must have been the last thing he did. Another goddamn hero.""\n\n""Everyone who died here will be honored when we get home,"" Salvucci says. \n\n""Oh good, because medals were really what I was concerned about,"" Meat says. ""I'm gonna go check the rest of the ship make sure nothing will snack on us while we sleep.""\n\n""I'll go with you,"" Salvucci says. ""Julia, go make sure the cryopods are ready.""\n\n1. [[Ready the cryopods.]]\n\n"
"""You can't be serious.""","""I already took one risk today, Julia, and that got someone else killed. Superstitious or not, we're doing this. Now come on.""\n\nSalvucci leaves the room. You turn to look at Meat. He's pale.\n\n1.[[""Good luck.""]]\n2.[[""Be careful.""]]\n3.[[""You sick fuck.""]]\n"
"""No, I don't.""","""So you're just as lonely and pathetic as I am. Well, misery, company and all that, I suppose.""\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit. You knock on the door.\nNeil's muffled voice comes from beyond the door: ""Password?""\n\n1.[[""Open the door, numbnuts.""]]\n2.[[""Oedipa.""]]"
"""Let's go kill it.""","Meat nods. ""Better than waiting around to die, I suppose.""\n\nSalvucci's demeanor doesn't shift. ""If we're going to do this, we need to have a plan. How many guns do we have?""\n\nYou all lay your firearms on one of the tables: one assault rifle with two clips, three pistols with 18 rounds each. In total, you have 94 rounds. You also have a Molotov cocktail, courtesy of Meat.\n\n""Is that it?"" says Salvucci.\n\nMeat can't hide his annoyance. ""What do you mean ‘is that it?' We have enough here to kill that thing fifty times over. Sorry, captain,"" he adds quickly.\n\nSalvucci doesn't bother acknowledging the insubordination. ""All right, tactics time. Everyone knows the layout of the ship, correct?""\n\n""Two main hallways. Left connects to crew quarters, common room, cafeteria, engineering, cryoroom, and bathrooms. The other leads to sickbay, cockpit, and the hanger,"" Strauss says quickly.\n\n""Pfft. Hanger, if you can call it that,"" Neil says. ""It's barely big enough to fit our droids.""\n\n""Is that really appropriate right now?"" Strauss says.\n\n""I'm just sayin'.""\n\n""The big question, then, is how we're dividing teams.""\n\n""I'm with Meat,"" Neil says quickly, eyeing the assault rifle.\nStrauss rolls her eyes.\n\n""What? I called dibs.""\n\n""Okay, so that puts Meat and Neil together. Zoe, you go with them too. Doctor Strauss and I will take the right hallway.""\n\n1. [[Follow Meat and Neil.]]"
"""I'm with Ryan.""","""In that case, I'm with Meat. Both groups will hike down the wall and take their respective tunnels. We've got the third one on the right,"" she says, pointing. ""You guys take the one over there.""\n\n1.[[""I've got a bad feeling about this.""]]\n2.[[""Roger that.""]]"
"Kill them both.","You take out the immiediate threat first, blowing Salvucci's mind out the back of his skull. The captain slumps.\n\nNeil puts his hand up to block the next round but the bullet tears through his palm and into his chest. He takes a step backward. You fire another shot. He falls back onto the console.\n\nGood child, the voice says. Now set a course for the human world.\n\nYou approach the console, pushing Neil's corpse out of the way. Neil was logged in, luckily. You play around with the settings until you find the autopilot and set a course for Mars.\n\nThe voice tells you it's proud of you and that great things await. It tells you to wait, so you do.\n\nLater on, your body seizes and you flop to the ground like a dying fish. You watch with a mixture of horror and fascination as your arm explodes, spraying blood, skin, and bits of bone everywhere, to reveal a purple jagged claw.\n\nNow, the voice says, your work truly begins. You follow its instructions and penetrate the chest cavities of Meat, Neil, and Salvucci with your claw. An hour later they've all risen. Of course, they're not really the people you knew. They're walking cocoons, dead flesh nuturing future soldiers.\n\nIt strikes you as odd that you should feel no guilt, but you chalk it up to how quickly you're evolving. Maybe guilt was, after all, a human weakness that needed to be culled. The closer you get to Mars, the more changes your body undergoes.\n\nFirst, another claw sprouts. Next, in your sleep, you lose your skin and find it replaced with a hard shell-like body. Your teeth fall from your mouth and are replaced with the kind of teeth monsters in fairy tales have.\n\nWhen you're a day away from the red planet, your soldiers hatch. They look like smaller versions of you.\n\nThey are to obey your every command, the voice says. Do not disappoint us, child.\n \nSoon you have forgotten your human life and have not only come to terms with what you are, but you look forward to your duties. The descendents of your new species will sing songs of your exploits and worship the very ground you have tread.\n\nMars looms and with it, your future.\n\n                      The End\n\n"
"""We need someone up in the vents.""","Meat raises an eyebrow. ""The ducts?""\n\nStrauss gets it. ""Of course. That's how it could be traveling.""\n\n""Not good survival odds though, if someone finds her up there,"" Neil says, eyes toward the ducts. ""That close proximity? With bullets that don't do shit? Yeah, I'm not gonna volunteer for that.""\n\n""Shit bird's right,"" Meat says. ""If it is hiding up there, we need to figure out how to draw it out. If we go into the vent, we're fucking toast.""\n\n""What kind of insult is ‘shit bird?'"" Neil mutters.\n\n1.[[Draw the monster out.]]"
"""Dangerous. I like it.""","""In any other situation, your reaction would be troubling.""\n\nThe door behind you clangs.\n\n""Shit,"" Strauss says, coating the last bullet. ""At least we don't have to bait it now.\n\nA louder bang now. A tentacle penetrates the door.\n\n""Come on, let's go!""\n\nYou leave through the other sickbay door. In the hallway, she hands you your pistol. You find the viewport. It's a spacious square of glass that takes up half the wall. Behind you, there is the sound of giant, reveberating footsteps.\n\n""He's coming. You get near the switch. I'll jump back after you shoot the window."" Strauss positions herself near the window; you stand next to the switch. \n\nThe creature approaches. It growls as it lumbers toward the doctor. Both the monster and Strauss are close to the window now.\n\n1. [[Shoot the window.]]\n2. [[Shoot Strauss first.]]"
"Attack with your gun.","You grab the pistol from your holster. Too slow. Markie's atop of you, her semi-human hand wrapped around neck before you can even pull it up to chest level.\n\nYou aim upward and fire a shot into her chest. She looks down at you and smiles. The claw is surprisingly quick as it rips open your throat.\n\n""Zoe!"" Meat cries, but you know you're a goner. You watch helplessy as Salvucci and Meat both tackle her. Strauss is screaming about the cryopod. Your vision is becoming blurry. \n\nYou hope your crewmates make it out OK and that they have nice words to say about you at your funeral.\n\nMost of all, though, you wish you had gone for the goddamn saw. You were so close to getting out of here.\n\nThe End\n\n"
"""Explanation please.""","""This, right here, is preserved acid. Right now it's completely safe but once the tempature is high enough, it does what acid does. Unfortunately, we can't really use it as a weapon against the beast itself.

"""Doc, put the gun down.""","""I had to kill him, you understand?"" she says. ""He attacked me.""\n\n""That's fine, doctor. He wasn't Ben anymore,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Relax, doc,"" Meat adds, rifle aimed at her chest.\n\n""He bit me,"" she says, holding up her arm to show the bite mark. ""Shit, he bit me.""\n\nMeat narrows his eyes and holds the rifle steadily. No one says anything. Tears begin to stream down Strauss' face.\n\n""Maybe if I had more time I could come up with a cure or a way to fight the virus, but I can feel it in me now, coursing through my body. There's blood in the back of my throat. Vision blurry. Minutes. That's how long this takes to change us.""\n\nShe looks at the pistol, turns it over in her hand as though she's seeing something she's never seen before.\n\n""Kill it,"" she says. ""Don't let it reach Mars.""\n\nBefore any of you can stop her, she's pressed the barrel under her chin and pulled the trigger. Red splashes the ceiling. Strauss falls forward, head smashing into the floor.\n\n""Jesus fuck,"" Meat yells.\n\nWhatever color was left in Salvucci's face drains. Meat, in a moment of calculated rage, lifts his foot high over Ben's skull and stomps it several times. The innards of the boy's head ooze out like the insides of a old tomato. After he's done with Ben, he steps over to Strauss' body and aims his rifle down at her head.\n\nHe looks at the captain, who nods. He fires four shots and obliterates the top half of the woman's face.\n\n""Shit shit shit,"" he groans, stepping away from the mutilated corpse.\n\n1.[[""We should get to Neil.""]]\n"
"""I'm with Meat.""","""I'll go with Sergeant Can't Keep It In His Pants, then.""\n\n""Hey!""\n\n""We'll hike down the wall and take our respective tunnels.

"""This is kind of a shitty idea.""","""Everything will be fine,"" Markie says. You go your separate ways, hiking down the cliff with Ryan. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel. You step inside.\n\n""Flashlights,"" Ryan says. You tell the computer to turn on the light attachment in your suit. It flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\n""Let's do this,"" he says, pulling out his pistol. You do the same.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head Up Display (HUD) of your helmet you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. Yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\n""Ten bucks we find caveman drawings.""\n\n1.[[""Sure, Ryan.""]]"
"""Where the fuck did she go, Ben? Talk to me.""","""She chased the doctor into the hallway. Can't believe Doctor Strauss left me here.""\n\nBefore you can say a word, something SLAMS into you, knocking you across the floor. You look up. Markie sits atop of Ben, a scalpel in her hand. You can only see the side of her face but you know that your friend is gone. Blood and grime are dripping off her body, and her skin is peeling.\n\nAs if to remove all trace of doubt the creature inside your friend speaks. ""Now now teacher's pet, no one likes a suck-up!""\n\n""The hell?!"" Meat roars.\n\nThe thing slams the scalpel into Ben's face, sinking the blade into his right eyeball.\n\n1. [[Rush her.]]\n2. [[Scream in terror.]]\n\n"
"""Take it easy on him.""","Strauss narrows her eyes at you. ""I shouldn't have to take it easy on him.

"Don't look at your foot.","He wheels you down to the cryo room where Neil and Salvucci are waiting.\n\n""There's captain kickass herself!"" the pilot says. ""Oh don't look so put out, I'll buy you a foam finger when we get back to Mars.""\n\n1. [[""Fuck. You.""]]\n2. [[Laugh.]]\n"
"Fire your pistol blindly.","Meat fires the rifle across the room, the gun's light chasing Markie's feet as she darts away. You raise your pistol and fire blindly in front of Meat's light, hoping to hit her with a lucky shot. Beside you, Neil screams in terror.\n\nYou hear the tell-tell click of the rifle as the clip goes dry. Meat swings the rifle around to point the flashlight at the door.\n\n""Go!""\n\nYou all make a beeline for the door. Meat yanks on the handle and light bleeds into the darkness as you all sprint into the hallway. You slam the door and then bend over to catch your breath. Luckily, you manage to pull back just in time to avoid the spew of vomit that erupts from Neil's mouth.\n\n""That was Markie—our Markie?"" he says, wiping the spittle from his lip.\n\n""Yeah, it was,"" Meat answers, a tinge of sadness in his voice.

"Look down","It's Ben. There's a giant slash across his cheek and his eyes are wide with fear, but he's alive. You lean down to help him to his feet. You tug but he doesn't get up. He whimpers in pain. Meat shines the light down where his feet should be; the upturned examination table has pinned his legs.\n\n""Travis, help me with this,"" Salvucci says, leaning down to grab the table.\n\n""Hang on, son,"" Meat says, handing you the rifle so that he can give Salvucci a hand.\n\n""She broke free...""

Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattle snake.\n\n""No!"" you hear Strauss scream as one of the tentacles darts out and wraps itself around her neck.

"""You too, okay?""","He smiles. The cab pulls away and you walk past your box—you'll get the mail later—and inside your home.\n\nThe door slides shut. And that's when you fall apart. You crumble to the floor and bawl yourself to sleep. You wake hours later only to cry yourself asleep again.\n\nWhen you wake up, you want to believe it's a new day but you can still feel the weight of the dead on your shoulders. It's a weight you never learn to completely shake, but you grow accustomed to it: the night terrors, the sudden flashes of the captain's dead eyes.\n\nMeat's friendship and an ungodly amount of therapy helps you get through the trauma, as does Melissa, the lovely barista who becomes your wife.

Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n""Run into any trouble?"" Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n""Didn't see a damn thing,"" Meat says.\n\n""I'm telling you,"" Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, ""we won't see it until it wants us to see it.""\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n""How's your arm, doctor?""

The thought strikes you that no one will ever know the sacrifices of you or your crew. You weep and Jessica asks what's wrong.\n\nYou lie. Just as you do when she asks you about the augmentations--the very ones she installed. ""Accident in the cryotube,"" you tell her. You're so wracked with guilt over these lies that you make it a priority to never lie to her about anything else. For the most part, your relationship is one built on trust.\n\nThree years after your return to Mars you're married. It's a simple ceremony. Your parents show up, as do the surviving members of your crew. You eat cake. You kiss.\n\nYou move in with Jessica even though her apartment is smaller than yours. You just love the view of the Martian landscape, and Jessica, quite content not to move anything, is more than happy to oblige you.\n\nOne day you catch a glimpse of light reflecting off the glass of the balcony window. You step onto the balcony and look out across the red canyons of your planet just to take in the beauty of it all. This is your new life, you tell youself. You've earned every second of it.\n             \nThe End\n\n"

"Sleep in the barracks.","In the barracks, Meat flips on the lights and the three of you find your respective beds.\n\n""Sleep tight, ladies,"" says Meat.\n\nTo your surprise, you find yourself drifting to sleep atop your bunk. Dreamless sleep covers your eyes. Briefly.\n\nYou awaken to the sound of choking. The first thing you see through blurred vision is a blood trail on the floor. You leap out of the bed and follow the trail out of the room to find Meat on the ground, neck slit. His eyes are watery as he grasps his throat.\n\n""Strauss,"" he chokes ""Strauss."" He nods toward the lounge.\n\nHe closes his eyes and is gone forever.\n\nYou go to the lounge. You open the door to find Strauss standing in the middle of the room, a bloody scalpel in her hand. Her back is to you.\n\n""Julia?"" she says, not turning to face you.\n\n1.[[""Lenore.""]]\n\n"
"Leave them to die.","It's a hard choice, but in the end, you get to your feet and sprint past the monster as it slaughters Strauss and Meat. You can hear their screams as you run down the hall. Soon things are mercifully silent. \n\nYou climb up into the ventilation and decide to make your base of operations there. You're a survivor, you tell yourself. All you have to do is stay alive two months. That's all.\n\nYou go, day by day, into the ship in search of supplies. You often go to the mess hall to stock up on food and bring it back to the vents. You run into the creature twice. Each time it's grown bigger, nastier. The first time, you get away without a scratch.\n\nThe second time, a tentacle pierces your ankle. You still manage to hop away, but you can't climb into the vent because of your injury. You seek refuge in the darkness of the barracks. Soon every breath brings pain. You refuse to accept the hand you've been dealt, even when Strauss, half her head missing, sits down beside you to have a chat.\n\n""You had a good run, idiot,"" she says. You stare at her ravaged face. \n\n1.[[""You're not fucking real.""]]"
"""Everybody chill the fuck out.""","""Believe me, Julia, I'm all for a drawn-out, rational conversation, but we can't afford that luxury. She could expire and change at any moment.""\n\n""This is a bad horror movie,"" Ben moans, staring into the glass while Markie gazes at her own cauterized stump. She's drooling now and has a nosebleed. You can see black veins popping beneath the skin on her forehead.\n\n""Enough,"" Salvucci says at last. ""We're not killing anyone on my ship—we're not savages.""\n\nMeat seems relived. ""Thanks boss.""\n\n""This is a mistake,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Maybe,"" he says, ""but it's my mistake to make, not yours. Do what you can to keep her alive and prep her for cryo sleep.""\n\n""Again, a mistake.""\n\n""Doctor Strauss, unless you want to be brought before a military tribunal for insubordination, I suggest you do as I say.\n\n""Yes, captain,"" she says, voice calm, but there's a fire in her eyes. ""Ben, lower the temperature to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We'll try to freeze her.""\n\nMarkie looks up at you all. A smile breaks out over her face and then she leans over and pukes.\n\n""Disgusting creature,"" Strauss mutters.\n\n""Travis, Julia, to the cockpit,"" Salvucci says.\n\n1. [[Go to the cockpit.]]\n"
"Find Neil.","You take the pistol from Meat's and proceed down the hall until you reach the cockpit. The door is unlocked.

"""You're still angry about that time she reset your broken finger, you big baby.""","Well, yeah, a bit. Maybe,"" he says, glancing at his finger. ""It hurt.""\n\nThe intercom clicks on before you can say anything. ""All officers report to sickbay,"" Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his bowl and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you're out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nYou and Meat exchange no words on the way to sickbay. The door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube. She's looking around wildly.\n\nYou smell gunsmoke. Ben has both of his hands wrapped around his pistol.\n\n1.[[""What happened?""]]\n\n\n"
"""Does it matter?""","""No. I guess it really doesn't, does it?"" He turns away from them, though you notice his eyes lingering on Strauss' corpse for a moment.\n\n""God, I just want some sleep.""\n\n1.[[""Let's sleep then.""]]"
"Say nothing to him. Leave.","You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I'll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nStrauss follows Meat. You look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Strauss and Meat, he's already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. Meat grabs Strauss and pulls her through. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently. \n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. Strauss looks on sadly.\n\n1.[[""Hey! Focus. I need you here.

Meat says, shoving his own pistol into Neil's hands.\n\n""Bro, I've never used one of these.""\n\n""Well, if it makes you feel better, it wouldn't help much anyway. Bitch is a bullet sponge.""\n\n""Oh good, you know for a minute there I thought I might actually have decent odds of survival.""\n\n""Quit bickering,"" Salvucci says sternly. ""We'll go for the vent in the central hallway. From there we can spread out and cover the whole ship.""\n\nYou all make your way to the central vent, located in the belly of the ship. Salvucci pushes a button on the wall; the vent shrieks open and down pops a ladder.\n\n""I'll go north. Travis, you're with me. Julia and Neil, you go south. We meet back here in twenty minutes. If you spot it, call for help.""\n\nYou watch as Meat and Salvucci ascend the ladder. You and Neil wait a minute and then go up. \n\nThe shaft is tight, but both of you manage to fit, with you at the front. You crawl slowly, pistol in hand.\n\n""You know,"" Neil says after you've been crawling for five minutes, ""I never thought I'd go like this. I thought that it'd be from a heart attack...in a bathroom or something, nude on a tile floor, ass up in the air.""\n\n1.[[""Please be quiet.""]]\n2.[[""Do tell.""]]\n"
"""Don't thank me.""","""I guess I shouldn't expect kindness from any of you, though I only did what had to be done.""\n\nMeat lights the rag and then tosses the bottle at the corpses.

You don't look back at the bodies, but you can hear the flesh crackling.\n\nStrauss is waiting for you down the hallway, arms folded, the stony quality of her face fully returned.

And then something else: A giant, bulbous, leaky sack that explodes when it hits the ground. Blood and pus fly everywhere. \n\nYou black out.\n\nWhen you come to, Meat's helping you up. He, like you and everyone else, is covered in gore.\n\n""Everyone all right?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n""Yeah, ugh this is so nast--"" Meat is interrupted by Strauss leaning over and vomiting on the floor.\n\n""Couldn't have said it better myself, doc. What was that?

"""Stay safe.""","The door bursts open and flies across the hanger. In steps the monster, mouth stained with blood, eyes looking about wildly.\n\nIt takes a step toward you.\n\n""Over here, motherfucker!""

Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall. He grabs onto a wall-railing.\n\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n""Do it, do it now.""\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\n\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he's behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n""Hold on!""\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they're pulled back as well.  \n\nA moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster's fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm. You can't help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n""We did it,"" Meat says.

"Say nothing.","Markie sighs. The four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss.

""Zoom,"" she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n""You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?"" Ryan teases Meat. ""I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y' know? Girls go for that sort of thing.""\n\nMeat grunts. ""Not my woman.

""It might try to use this plan against us.""\n\nYou reach the hanger in two minutes.

The captain's pistol is on the floor several feet from the pair.\n\n""She's wounded,"" Meat says, defeated. ""Infected.""\n\nMarkie is shuffling closer, giggling. Strauss sees the three of you. She looks over at the panel that controls the hanger door and then looks back at you all. She nods.\n\nYou slowly raise your pistol. Markie grabs the doctor by the throat and lifts her into the air. She chokes.\n\nYou feel Meat beside you raising his rifle. His hands are shaking.\n\n1. [[End Strauss' pain.]]\n2. [[Shoot the switch.]]\n\n\n\n\n"

Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters of Earth—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n""Run into any trouble?""

"Pull the trigger.","You squeeze the trigger twice. Each round hits, but it doesn't even faze him. Ben opens his mouth and a moan leaks out. All of his teeth are gone. This close, you can see that the iris of his remaining eye is yellow. You take aim again.\nSalvucci, standing on his wounded leg, beats you and Meat to it.\n\nThe captain grabs Ben by the side of his face and throws him into the wall. The thing moans as it hits the floor. It's surprisingly quick to rise, but Salvucci already has the crowbar in his hand.\n\nHe grunts and brings the curved end down on the back of Ben's head hard. The thing crumbles and is hit again as it slowly lifts its head. Red and yellow matter splatter the wall—little squirts at first, but they grow larger once the back of the skull caves in and brain matter flies. \n\nSalvucci drops the crowbar after the fifth hit and falls back onto the floor, out of breath.\n\nMeat approaches the beast. It slowly sticks its hand out toward him, fingers crawling across the floor like a wounded spider. Meat raises his boot above the monster's head and stomps. Once. Twice. \n\nBen convulses. He goes still after the third impact. Meat steps past the body and helps Salvucci to his feet.\n\n""Holy shit, cap,"" Neil says, looking at the leg wound. \n\n""I'll brush it off,"" Salvucci says, limping to the door.

All you have to do is stay alive two months. That's all.\n\nYou go, day by day, into the ship in search of supplies. You often go to the mess hall to stock up on food and bring it back to the vents.

You still manage to hop away, but you can't climb into the vent because of your injury. You seek refuge in the darkness of the barracks. Soon every breath brings pain.

You never marry, though you do have a series of healthy relationships with their ups and downs.\n\nTwenty years later, Strauss sends you an email out of the blue; ""I'm sorry"" is all it says. The next morning the local news reports the suicide of a renowneddoctor. You turn off the TV before the anchor says her name. Though you never really talked after the Speedwell incident, you can't help but feel that your universe is a little smaller without Dr. Lenore Strauss in it.\n\nYou are now alone.\n\nThe End"
"""Where's Markie?""","""Dead,"" he says. ""All thanks to you. We're alive and going home.""\n\nHe looks away. ""But....""\n\n1.[[""What is it, Travis?""]]"
"""The whole foot?""","""The whole enchileda. But look at it this way: you get a cool robo foot now! And some fingers too! And we're all gonna get citations after this at the very least.""\n\n1.[[""Except for the dead.""]]\n2.[[""I better get a lot more than a citation for my goddamn foot.""]]\n"
"""Ben's dead.""","Strauss closes her eyes and momentarily bites her lip. ""I'm a coward.""\n\nSalvucci holsters his gun. ""There's nothing you could have done, doctor. Let's go.""\n\nStrauss looks up, her remorse stowed away or perhaps an illusion. ""What about the creature?""\n\n""Meat's burning the bodies.""\n\nHer eyes widen. ""Why the everliving hell is that lumbering mountain of idiocy doing such a thing?""\n\n""He thinks they might come back.""\n\n""That fucking idiot! We don't know how that infection works. It could be twice as deadly as an airborne virus. I need those bodies intact. Call him! Stop him!""\n\nSalvucci's face goes pale. ""I don't have a walkie.""\n\n""Run,"" she says.\n\nAnd you do. As fast as you can. Inside sickbay you find Meat, sitting down on the floor, staring at where the bodies should be, but instead there's only a lot of blood and some meaty chunks.\n\nAn oil can, a bottle, and a rag are next to Meat.\n""Where are they?""  Strauss demands. ""The bodies? Where are they?""\n\n""Oh good. You're alive,"" Meat says. You can feel the force of his eyeroll from here.\n\n""Where are the bodies? Did you burn them?""\n\n""No, doctor. As you would have gathered from the lack of smoke if you weren't a nutjob, I have not burned a damn thing. I came back and they were gone.""\n\nStrauss approaches Meat, gets in his face. ""Well did they just fucking get up and walk off?""\n\nHe yells back. ""I don't know!""\n\n""Everyone relax,"" Salvucci says, voice raised.  Meat and Strauss calm down, both refusing to look at the other, both saying nothing.\n\n""We've got two missing bodies, possibly infected and mutated into hostile lifeforms."" Salvucci rubs his forehead. ""I need thoughts, suggestions, anything. Where should we go from here?""  He turns to you first. \n\n1.[[""We should check on Neil.""]]\n2.[[""Let's go hunting.""]]\n"
"Go ahead and shoot the switch.","Meat fires. Strauss' head falls back and her limbs go limp. Markie turns to see all of you. She growls and drops Strauss.\n\nThat's when you fire a single shot at the control panel. Upon impact, the door seperating the hanger from the rest of the ship comes down, dividing you from the hanger. Alarms blare. You watch through the door's window as both Strauss' corpse and the creature are sucked out into space. The two forms drift away until they're dots, inseparable from distant stars.\n\nNone of you give a cheer or breathe a sigh of relief, however. There's a sense of shame that hangs over all of you, an awareness of your cowardice. You played it safe so that one of your crewmates could sacrafice herself.\n\nThe auto-close kicks in and the hanger door shuts itself. The alarms cease their cries.\n\n""We should go check Neil's console,"" Meat says.\n\nThe three of you silently make your way to the cockpit. Inside, you find the autopilot already engaged. The console is covered in blood; the pilot's headless corpse is behind it.\n\n""He knew he wasn't going to make it,"" Meat says bitterly. ""Setting the autopilot must have been the last thing he did. Another goddamn hero.""\n\n""Everyone who died here will be honored when we get home,"" Salvucci says. \n\n""Oh good, because medals were really what I was concerned about,"" Meat says. ""I'm gonna go check the rest of the ship make sure nothing will snack on us while we sleep.""\n\n""I'll go with you,"" Salvucci says. ""Zoe, go make sure the cryopods are ready.""\n\n1.[[Go ready the pods.]]\n"
"""The fuck is wrong with you?""","Her lip twitches. \n\n""Yes, I am fucking taking off her arm because it's required by protocol. So get out of here so I can do my fucking job. Thanks.""\n\nShe turns away from you to get to work. Ben looks from you to her without saying anything. He turns back to the tablet in his hands.\n\n1.[[""I am so close to shoving that saw up your ass.""]]\n2. [[Say nothing. Leave.]]"
"""You sick bastard.""","Meat turns away without a word. He leaves through the other sickbay door.\n\nYou step outside to find Salvucci loading his pistol.\n\n""Better to be safe than sorry. Do you have your pistol?""\n\nYou nod.\n\n""Good. Hopefully we won't need it.""\n\nThe two of you walk down the hallway. Salvucci appears to be deep in thought.\n\n1.[[""It ain't your fault.""]]\n2.[[""Why the long face, cap?""]]\n\n"
"""Everyone okay?""","""Good question. Doctor?"" Salvucci says, turning to Strauss. \n\nShe's red in the face, clearly panicked.\n\n""There's no way to know we're infected until we start seeing symptoms.""\n\n""Which would be...""\n\n""I don't know, Travis. From our brief experience with Markie's transformation, I would be inclined to say that we would drop to the floor and start babbling nonsense while our bodies decayed...but she was bitten. If there was an airbone virus when that blob exploded, our transformations could be much more subtle. There's no way to know until whatever happens, happens.""\n\n""A comforting thought,"" Neil says.\n\n""The best thing we can do right now is just wait. Maybe some of us get some shut eye and then rotate the guard.""\n\n""What are the guards looking out for, exactly?""\n\nStrauss looks at Meat and takes a breath. ""Symptoms. In case something goes wrong with one of the sleepers.""\n\nSalvucci nods. ""We're all a bit tired. Meat, Julia, doctor, you three rest first. Neil and I will keep watch.""\n\n""Make sure not to turn into boogeymen,"" Neil says as the three of you head toward the barracks.\n\n""If I do, I'll eat you first, little man,"" Meat answers.\n\n1. [[Sleep in the barracks.]]"
"Go ready for the cryopods for the two of you.","You head to the cryogenics room and boot up two pods. On the terminal, in the bottom left corner of the screen, a window of text catches your eye.\n\n1.[[Read the text on the screen.]]\n2.[[Finish programming the pods.]]"
"Dart into the kitchen.","You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He's a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body's back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren't far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Meat is looking over the bloody hole in Neil's chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil's mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I'm so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn't fast enough...""\n\nHis wound looks deep.\n\nHe turns to you. ""Zo...Zoe, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is..."" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I. Got it?""\n\n1.[[""Shhh. I got it, Neil. Just rest.""]]\n"
"""It's covering its own noises.""","""Well, we're about to put an end to that shit,"" Meat says as you approach the crew's quarters. You see large cables running through the doorway; they lead up the wall and into the ceiling.\n\nNeil reaches up and runs his hand along the cables. He quickly pulls it back. ""Augh! Fuck!""\n\n""What is it?"" Meat barks.\n\n""Nothing,"" Neil says, regaining his composure. ""Just fucking slime. Oh god, gag a maggot,"" he says. ""This shit reeks."" He holds his hand up to the light to reveal a goopy, transparent liquid.\n\n""Hey, that looks a little bit like—""\n\n""Don't you say it, Travis.""\n\nYou examine the cables without touching them.\n\nMeat takes a look as well. ""Seems like a complicated operation.""\n\n""What, turning on the computer, starting a program, and plugging in some cables?""\n\nMeat turns. ""You didn't see how feral this thing was—not to mention she's missing a goddamn arm.""\n\n1.[[""Could be Ben.""]]\n"
"""What the hell is she saying?""","""Complete gibbersh, sounds like,"" Lenore says with cold detachment. ""Move."" \n\nShe scoots past you and turns on the device in her hand. A hot laser point darts out about three inches from the top port of the device. Another line escapes the bottom port and swings around to connect to the top line.\n\n""Cauterizing saw,"" she explains. ""You might want to leave this to the professionals, girlie. It's going to get a little messy.""\n\n1.[[""You're not really going to take her arm off, are you?""]]\n2.[[""The fuck is wrong with you?""]]\n3. [[Say nothing. Leave.]]"
"""What's with the racket?""","'It's been in Neil's room. Somehow it's hooked up all his music to the PA system and is playing it. This is the third song.""\n\nYou look over at Neil. He shrugs sheepishly. Strauss is glaring at him.\n\n""The blasted beast is trying to draw us out,"" Salvucci says.\n\n1.[[""Guess we should go investigate, eh?""]]\n"
"""I really don't know.""","""Guess it isn't much use wondering about it, huh?"" He turns away from them, though you notice his eyes lingering on Strauss' corpse for a moment.\n\n""God, I just want some sleep.""\n\n1.[[""Let's sleep then.""]]\n"
"""I'm ready to go hunting.""","""I like the sound of that!"" Meat says, slapping your back.\n\n""Hunt it with what, precisely? You shot it in the head, right?"" Strauss says.\n\n""Yeah.""\n\n""It got back up, right?""\n\n""Yeah, but this time I'll make it stay dead.""\n\n""With fire? You ignorant ape, what if those bodies are toxic? What if we inhale a virus?""\n\n""Doc, it's not that fucking hard. We set them on fire and then close the door. We lock it, don't enter it for the rest of the voyage home.""\n\n""This is a horrible plan.""\n\n""Well, doctor Strauss,"" Salvucci interjects, ""do you have another plan in mind?""\n\nShe looks at the floor and then back at him. ""No. I don't, in fact.""\n\n""Then you're not giving us much of a choice."" \n\n""Should we split up to cover more ground?"" Meat asks.\n\n""No. I think we'll all stay together for this. Strength in numbers.""\n\n""Yes sir.""\n\n""Where should we hunt first, though?""\n\n1.[[""Let's head to the mess hall.""]]\n2.[[""Let's head to the barracks.""]]\n"
"Go for the gun.","You dive and grasp the rifle. It's in your hands when you see Markie twisting the knife in Ben's skull; the boy convulses.\n\nYou aim down the sights, but the captain beats you to it, his pistol planted against her temple. He fires. Brain, skull bits, and strands of hair blast across the light and onto the floor. The thing that was Markie topples over to the ground, blood spewing out of the nose and mouth as it giggles.\n\nThe red eyes roll around in her head like in a slot machine before settling on you.\n\n""Buy two hypostims, get three free. Just come on down to the Couponia at Rylock's junction this Saturday—""\n\nSalvucci puts another bullet in its face. Markie jerks and then stops moving completely.\n\nMeat bends down to examine Ben. ""He's dead,"" he says. The boy's face is a sea of blood and torn flesh. Half his eyeball has been pushed up through the socket.\n\nA moment passes. Meat raises his gun and puts a round through Ben's head. You leap back in surprise.\n\n1.[[""What the hell was that for?""]]\n2. [[Give Meat a chance to explain.]]\n"
"You have kids.","You and Jack adopt. Her name is Sarah, she's seven and has quite an imagination. Meat becomes her godfather. \n\nSarah goes to college to become a writer.\n\nYou make enough money to retire. You grow old and stop shaving your legs because who gives a fuck? Jack's hair goes white first. Yours follows shortly. You decide not to get anti-aging treatments.\n\nSarah gets engaged to a pretty girl named Alexandria. You're not sure you approve of her.\n\n1. [[Approve of Alex.]]\n2. [[Disapprove of her.]]\n"
"""So if we can't burn its flesh off, what are we doing?""","""I'm getting there. The viewport windows are bulletproof, but enough acid might penetrate all the layers. All it takes is one crack on the outside layer.""\n\n1.[[""We space it?""]]"
"Risk your life to save Meat.","The hail of bullets clip the tentacle above Meat. It falls to the floor, but the beast itself is unfazed. Meat scrambles over to you.\n\n""We've got to go now.""\n\nYou and Meat run past the monster. It swings a tentacle at you that comes close to taking off both your heads. The monster howls as you rush past it. \n\nYou both run until Meat, out of breath, stops in a distant hallway. You fall to the ground, back against the wall.\nYou both take a breath.\n\n""What happens now?""\n\n1.[[""We put that thing down. Hard.""]]\n2.[[""I've got two bullets left.""]]\n"
"Continue toward the mess hall.","""See?"" Meat says. ""Juila says he'll be fine too. He's a big boy.""\n\n""Idiot,"" Strauss says.\n\nThe four of you make your way to the mess hall. \n\n""Check everything,"" Salvucci orders. You check around the tables and near the entertainment closest while Meat looks around the kitchen. Salvucci keeps his eyes on the door. Strauss sits at a table away from everyone.\n\nYou find some soy raisin cookies and pocket them. No monsters, though.\n\nMeat pokes his head out of the kitchen. ""Nothing."" He looks at all of you and shrugs his shoulders. ""What now?""\n\nAs if to answer him, a loud shriek erupts from the vent hanging over you all.\n\n""A GIFFTTTTT,"" Markie screams from the vent.\n\n""Oh god,"" Strauss says, backing into the wall.\n\n""Kill it,"" Salvucci says, raising his pistol. You, Meat, and Salvucci fire into the vent.\n\n""Don't waste your ammo. Just a few shots,"" Meat yells.\n\nYou fire half of your clip and lower your weapon. The vent cover drops to the floor. Meat and Salvucci lower their guns as well.\n\n""We got her, right?"" Meat says.\n\n""agiftagiftagiftagift,"" Markie answers from the vent.\n\n""Fuck me.""\n\n""agiftagiftagiftAGIFTAGIFTAGIFT,"" she screams. At first, you're not sure what falls from the vent. You just see a small, almost circular object dropping through the air. When it hits the ground with a splat, you know what it is, but you can't bring yourself to look.\n\nStrauss' screams confirm your fears. You finally look down; it's Neil's head. Both his eyes have been gouged out and there's a jagged line of flesh and muscle where he was decapitated.\n\n""A GIFT!"" Markie yells once more before you hear her scamper away further into the ducts.\n\n""I told you,"" Strauss, the first to speak, says. ""We should have sent someone to look after him.\n\nMeat kicks over a table.\n\n""I told you!"" Strauss screams at him.\n\n""Doctor, quiet,"" Salvucci barks. He lowers his voice. ""We'll mourn later.""\n\n""If we fucking live that long,"" Meat says.\n\n""We have to trap it,"" Strauss says suddenly. ""I think it's pretty clear bullets aren't effective. We need to either space her or trap her in a tightly contained space and set that bitch on fire.""\n\n""Risky options,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""For once, I'm in agreement with the good doctor. This thing is shrugging off bullets like their bug bites. Question is: burn it or space it?""\n\n1. [[Space it.]]\n2. [[Burn it.]]\n\n\n\n"
"""It had a lot of tentacles.""","""If it's not dead, we're fucked. All we got left is your pistol. I'm guessing you're down to two clips.""\n\nYou pop the clip out of your pistol to show him it's the last one.\n\n""Shit.""\n\n""We don't know if it's alive. If it is, we'll improvise.""\n\n""Great, I wonder who'll die next time thanks to our masterful improvisation abilities.""\n\nStrauss says nothing. \n\nA few minutes later you reach the cockpit door. Ben's body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n\n""Well, that's good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You notice that Strauss is deliberately looking away from Ben's smashed skull.\n\nThe three of you step into the cockpit. You slam the door behind you.\n\n""Here's the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you. You type in ""KONAMI.""\n\nThe screen changes to a selection of menus.\n\n""There's the autopilot,"" says Strauss. She touches the screen and selects NEW AUSTIN.\n\n""We done?"" Meat asks.\n\n""Yeah, I think we're set.""\n\n""Good.""\n\nAll of you approach the door.\n\n""Now let's get out of here before that fucking thing corn—"" \n\nA tentacle sweeps through the door as soon as it opens and brushes all of you aside with a mighty swing. You all going flying across the room. You slam into the viewport, cracking the glass, and then fall to the floor. Looking up, you see the thing step into view: it's monstrous, with a greekly perfect human abdomen. \n\nThe monster's face is distinctly unhuman with countless, slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster's mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattlesnake.\n\n""No!"" you hear Strauss scream as one of the tentacles darts out and wraps itself around her neck.  It lifts her into the air and pulls her toward its master. You turn to look at Meat who's paralyzed with fear, watching one of the tentacles dance above him.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Save Meat.]]\n2. [[Save Strauss.]]\n3. [[Save yourself.]]\n"
"Punch her.","""I didn't have--"" the impact from your fist sends her to the floor.\n\nShe starts to get back up, but Meat yanks her off her feet and slams her into the wall.\n\n""Fuck!"" she screams, blood across her lower lip. He wraps his hands around her throat.\n\nShe chokes and claws at his face in desperation. ""Help me,"" she says, her eyes bulging out at you.\n\n""You'd do the same to any of us, wouldn't you?"" Meat shouts in her face.\n\n""Travis...stop,"" Neil says.\n\n""No, she'd kill us all if it worked to her advantage, Neil. I don't want someone like that behind us.""\n\nStrauss' face is getting red.\n\n1.[[""Let her go.""]]\n2. [[Look into her eyes as she dies.]]\n\n"
"Play Tic-Tac-Toe.","Neil grabs a tablet from the counter and opens the Tic-Tac-Toe program that comes installed on every device. You play seven times and tie each time.\n\n""This game is pretty dumb,"" he says.\n\nYou're about to start the eighth round when the second door to sickbay opens, and Meat and Salvucci step inside; both men wear dark expressions.\n\n""I'm guessing your hunt was uneventful?"" Strauss says.\n\n""Yeah, go on and rub it in then,"" Meat says, turning to rifle through the medical cabinets.\n\n""What are you looking for?""\n\n""Food.""\n\n""This is a medical facility. What makes you think there's food in here?""\n\nMeat opens one of the lower cabinets and, after a moment, pulls out a large bag of apricot chips.\n\n""Your assistant told me about his stash a while back.""\n\n""I'm glad you can eat his food while his remains are in the same room as you.""\n\n""Not like he's going to need them,"" Meat says with a shrug.\n\n""Enough you two,"" Salvucci barks. ""Pilot, you all right?""\n\n""Yeah, I'm fine, captain. Thanks for asking.""\n\n""Did you three see anything?""\n\n""No,"" Strauss says.\n\n1.[[""Where on the ship did you look?""]]\n2.[[""Did it leave a trail?""]]"
"Leave.","You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I'll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nStrauss follows Meat. You look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Strauss and Meat, he's already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. Meat grabs Strauss and pulls her through. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently. \n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. Strauss looks on sadly.\n\n1. [[Touch his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Do nothing.]]"
"Shoot Strauss first.","You put a bullet in Strauss' leg. She falls to the ground screaming ""No!""\n\nThe beast advances.\n\nShe turns, reaching toward you with an outstretched hand. ""I don't want to die!""\n\nYou unload the rest of your clip into the viewport and press the button on the wall. The door comes down, separating you from Strauss and the monster. Through the window you watch the beast lift its massive foot above Strauss' head and then brings it down, snapping her neck.\n\nThe viewport finally shatters, sucking both the beast and Strauss' corpse into space. An alarm blares for a couple of seconds before the emergency panel closes over the viewport.\n\nYou breathe a sigh of relief. You're alive. You won.\n\nYour body aches, but you have one last thing to do before you can enter the cryochamber. You don't know how to make a molotov cocktail, so you go around the ship in search of bodies. When you find them, if they have a skull, you stomp it in.\n\nAfter you're done, you go to the cryoroom and ready one of the pods.It hisses as the hatch slides open. You get inside and close your eyes.\n\nYou're ready for this nightmare to be over.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod. \n\nYou're transported to a private room on the biggest military outpost in New Austin. You order steak and wine but find that you don't have an appetite. Some suits interview you. You answer all of their questions honestly, but then they show you security footage of you shooting Strauss.\n\n""Explain,"" one of them, a beefy looking man with no hair, demands.\n\n1.[[""She had killed the captain. Karma.""]]\n2.[[""I needed to ensure my survival. She was bait.""]]\n3.[[""She was infected.""]]"
"Kill Markie.","""Here's what we're going to do,"" Salvucci starts. \n\nThe sudden discharge of your pistol cuts him off. The first two rounds shatter the quarantine glass. You approach the cube. \n\nSomeone—-Meat perhaps?-—is shouting something, but it's too late. You're raising your gun, leveling it at Markie's head. She looks up at you, uncomprehending.\n\nYou fire once.  A mixture of red and yellow liquid spills out of the back of her head as her body crumples. The smell is excruciating. You gag. And that's when Meat smashes the butt of his rifle into your face.\n\nYou black out.\n\nYou wake up two months later in a cell where Salvucci, with a mixture of sympathy and disgust hiding behind his blue eyes, explains how they put you in cryo sleep for the rest of the journey home and how, now, you will be brought before a military tribunal for the murder of your fellow crewmember.\n\nHe refuses to listen when you try to explain your actions and offers you only one comfort before leaving: he hears your lawyer is pretty damn good.\n\nAnd she is. She manages to convince the court that you committed, not murder, but manslaughter out of concern for your crew. You serve five years at Titan penitentiary. After beating the living piss out of the first person who tries to intimidate you, no one messes with you for the rest of your sentence.\n\nUpon release, you became a jack of all trades, mostly those related to physical labor. The years pass. You work as a plumber,a construction worker, a repairwoman for Mal's Repair. The last one turns out to be the job you keep for most of your life. It's not what you dreamed of being, but it pays rent, groceries, and then some.\n\nEventually you get lonely and give Meat a call, hoping to reconcile. He's not there. You leave a message, but he never calls back. You have night terrors and imagine Markie's face, her yellow eyes, staring at you from beyond the darkness. \n\nWhen you were younger, you told yourself you'd never be a cat lady, so you become an alpaca lady instead. Most of your free time and extra money are dedicated to purchasing cute clothes for your robo-alpaca. You call her CiCi. You have lovely, one-sided conversations.\n\nFinally, some fifty years after you killed Markie, you begin to feel life slip away from you. You're not sure if it's disease or depression or some form of universal comeuppance, but you let yourself go piece by piece. You're defiant all the way to the end. ""I did the right thing,"" you mutter to yourself. ""I saved lives."" \n\nSoon you fall into eternal rest. You leave Cici to your younger sister, but she never comes for her.\n\n                          The End\n"
"""Yeah, they're not getting back up.""","""Either way, we'll burn the corpses. Travis, take care of it.""\n\n""On it,"" Meat says, leaving you two alone.\n\n""Come on, we'll head to the cockpit. See if we can figure out how to fly this thing.""\n\nIf only it were that easy. You and Salvucci discover Neil's console locked.\n\n""Did he ever tell you his password?""\n\n1. [[""No, he didn't.""]]\n"
"""Fucking thing ate him.""","""Fuck. All right, let's get her aboard.""\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship's elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there's no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat. ""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where's she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie's drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it's just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What's she saying?""]]\n2.[[""What is that?""]]\n\n"
"Shoot.","You fire several rounds as well, tearing off her other arm. Still, the body convulses. You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He's a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body's back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run!

Strauss roars, pointing with her free hand at the cryochamber in the corner of the room. Meat and the captain are quick, grabbing the creature by its arm while it flails about. They pull it by the rotting arm to the chamber quickly. The pod hisses as it opens. Markie snaps at them, tries to attack with her claw but she can't get a shot in. She shrieks as Meat and Salvucci heave her into the pod.\n\nYou smash the pod's panel with your fist and the chamber closes. You can hear Markie's muffeled screams from within. \n\nShe starts to smack the door with her claw; cracks appear in the glass.\n\n""Whatever you're doing do it fast, doc."" Meat says, aiming his rifle at the pod.\n\n""Put your gun down and take this,"" she says, passing off the hose from the machine. Meat takes it. ""Now, plug it into the port at the bottom of the pod. Hurry! And make sure it's plugged in tight.""\n\nAnother crack in the glass. Meat takes the hose and screws it into the pod's hole.\n\n""Let go!""\n\nMeat backs away from the hose. Strauss presses several buttons on the machine.\n\n""What is that?"" Salvucci says.\n\n""It's the incinerator,"" she says, slamming her palm down on one last button. You hear the roar of the flames as they pass through the hose and into the chamber itself. The inside of the pod lights up as Markie's screams become even louder. \n\nMarkie beats against the glass harder with her claw, but it's useless. Within minutes, the creature's been vaporized.\n\nFor a moment, no one says anything. And then, just as you're all about to take a breath, in stumbles what was once Ben.

We're turning back.""\n\nMeat nods at you and you both slowly back away.\n\n""What do you see, Meat?"" Markie asks.\n\n""Dunno. Don't like it whatever it is."" \n\nThe whine again. You focus your eyes and see something moving in the dark.\n\nMeat sees it, too. He fires at it. As muzzle flash fills the cave with brief spells of light you see that the creature isn't one thing, but many things, with feelers and sharp teeth.\n\nThey rush toward you, hundreds of them.\n\n""Let's get out of here!"" Meat yells.\n\n1.[[Shoot them.]]\n2.[[Run away.]]"

Yours flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head-Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad.

Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with sweat. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that's not what's making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n""Stay away from me,"" Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n""Now,"" Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn't even have time to turn her head before machinegun fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You're not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you. Luckily, there's not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n""Oh godfuckingshit,"" Neil yells. ""That was Markie."" He takes a step closer to the body, his arm over his nose. ""So, we like win now, right? They're all dead?""\n\n""Yeah, I think—""\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie's hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump.

You can see black veins popping beneath the skin on her forehead.\n\n""Enough,"" Salvucci says at last. ""We're not killing anyone on my ship—we're not savages.""\n\nMeat seems relived. ""Thanks, boss.""\n\n""This is a mistake,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Maybe,"" he says, ""but it's my mistake to make, not yours. Do what you can to keep her alive and prep her for cryo sleep.""\n\n""Again, a mistake.""\n\n""Dr. Strauss, unless you want to be brought before a military tribunal for insubordination, I suggest you do as I say.\n\n""Yes, captain,"" she says, voice calm, but there's a fire in her eyes. ""Ben, lower the temperature to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We'll try to freeze her.""\n\nMarkie looks up at you all. A smile breaks out over her face and then she leans over and pukes.\n\n""Disgusting creature,"" Strauss mutters.\n\n""Travis, Julia, to the cockpit,"" Salvucci says.\n\n1. [[Go to the cockpit.]]"
"""Let's go hunting.""","""I like the sound of that!"" Meat says, slapping your back.\n\n""Hunt it with what, precisely? You shot it in the head, right?"" Strauss says.\n\n""Yeah.""\n\n""It got back up, right?""\n\n""Yeah, but this time I'll make it stay dead.""\n\n""With fire? You ignorant ape, what if those bodies are toxic? What if we inhale viruses?""\n\n""Doc, it's not that fucking hard. We set them on fire and then close the door. We lock the room, don't enter it for the rest of the voyage home.""\n\n""This is a horrible plan.""\n\n""Well, doctor Strauss,"" Salvucci interjects, ""do you have another plan in mind?""\n\nShe looks at the floor and then back at him. ""No. I don't, in fact.""\n\n""Then you're not giving us much of a choice."" \n\n""Should we split up to cover more ground?"" Meat asks.\n\n""No. I think we'll all stay together for this. Strength in numbers.""\n\n""Yes sir.""\n\n""Where should we hunt first, though?""\n\n1. [[Mess hall]]\n2. [[Barracks]]\n"
"Blast it.","You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He's a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body's back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren't far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Strauss and Meat are looking over the bloody hole in Neil's chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil's mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I'm so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn't fast enough...""\n\n""Stop talking, sweetie,"" Strauss says, taking you by surprise with the earnest care in her voice as she examines the wound. ""An artery's been pierced.""\n\n""Shit, is there anything you can do for him?""\n\nStrauss looks at you both, clearly not wanting to give her answer in front of Neil. You feel a tap on your arm. Neil looks up at you.\n\n""Zoe, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is..."" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I. Got it?""\n\n1.[[""Yeah. I understand.""]]"
"Burn it.","""I'm a fan of anything that doesn't include the possibility of us getting sucked out into space.""\n\n""We just might catch the whole ship on fire is all,""  Salvucci says.\n\n""Not if we do it right. We need to trap it in sickbay, where the extra cryopod is.""\n\n""Isn't that one broken?"" Meat  asks.\n\n""Yeah, which is perfect for us.""\n\n""I thought we were going to use fire?""\n\n""We are. Just...just trust me, okay?""\n\n Salvucci nods. ""Okay, doctor. What do we need to do.""\n\n""Give me your gun. I'm gonna run ahead and try and get it to follow.""\n\n""That's insane!"" Meat yells\n\n""It's already established I'm the weakest out of all of us. It'll track me. You guys follow behind at a distance and when you get there, you do exactly as I say, okay?""\n\nSalvucci hands her his pistol. ""Stay safe,"" he says.\n\nShe nods. She goes to the door.

"""You aren't real.""","""No,"" she says, turning away from you. ""But it is.""\n\nYou turn just in time to make out the tentacle that rends your head from your body.\n\nThe last sound you hear is the beast roaring with satisfaction.\n\nThe End\n"
"""See you at home.""","You slide into your chamber and the hatch closes. You quickly fall into slumber. When you wake up, you're surounded by soldiers. One of them, a corporal, is saying something but his words are soundless. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, and Meat are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. All of you are given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nJust as Meat said, men in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, and Salvucci meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in almost complete silence, only uttering the names of the lost from time to time.\n\nYou all take seperate cabs home. When you reach your house in the suburbs, you pass your mailbox but decide to check it later. It's only when you swipe your card against the door's reader and hear it unlock that you feel as though you are truly safe. Inside, you shut the door and hang up your coat.\n\nYou go into the living room and sit on the couch. You do nothing but stare at the wall for hours, in a trance of sorts. You rub you finger up and down one of the cushions of your couch. You are alive to do this, but you're not sure you're thankful for that.\n\nYou begin to see a therapist. You make progress--according to him, anyway. You never really shake the memories of your time aboard the Speedwell, but you're able to cope with them.\n\nThat's more than can be said for Captain Salvucci, who eats \na bullet on the third anniversary of your return to Mars.\n\nYou don't go to the funeral.\n\nYou and Meat stay in contact but the emails you send one another are largely going through the motions bullshit. Your failure to connect with him is indicative of your relationship with the rest of humankind. You never marry or even begin what you're comfortable calling a relationship with anyone. For the first ten years or so this bothers you but you slowly grow comfortable with this new you.\n\nYou become a writer. Your sci-fi espionage novels sell well enough for you to live comfortably by yourself and away from everyone. You're mostly happy but sometimes there's a thought strikes you like the lash of a whip.\n\nYou are alone.\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n\n"
"""You're right. She's probably dead.""","You open your mouth to speak, but you're cut off by a familiar voice.  ""Well, captain, I guess it's too much to hope for some confidence in my abilities.""\n\nOut from a supply closet steps Strauss.  Sweat is dripping off her face; there's blood on her lab coat.\n\n""Doctor, are you hurt?""\n\n""No,"" she says. ""It broke through the glass and grabbed me, but Ben pushed it off. I ran and didn't look back. I heard him scream behind me.""\n\nSalvucci looks at you nervously.\n\n1.\t[[""Ben's dead.""]]\n2.\t[[""You left him to die, you bitch.""]]\n\n"
"""That's what you get.""","""Please hurry,"" she begs. ""We're in the cockpit.""\n\n""Hustle people,"" Meat says, breaking out into a sprint.\n\nYou and Neil follow.\n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner, and his face goes pale. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci's leg and tearing away flesh and muscle. Salvucci is against the cockpit's door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is on the ground next to him.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n""Conserve the ammo,"" Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben's neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate's skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben's youthful face glares at you. \n\nThe thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He's closing in.\n\n""Well don't just stand there—shoot him!""\n\nYou aim down the sight of your pistol.\n\n1. [[Pull the trigger.]]\n"
"""Yeah. You too, doc.""","When you get inside your house, you finally allow yourself to break down and cry. For the dead, for you, for Strauss.\n\nIt takes years for you to come to terms with the fact that you're alive. You see a therapist to help you cope with the nightmares and PTSD episodes. You are reassigned to a boring job as an analyst, an occupation you're fine with. You never marry, though you do have a series of healthy relationships with their ups and downs.\n\nTwenty years later, Strauss sends you an email out of the blue; ""I'm sorry"" is all it says. The next morning the local news reports the suicide of a renowned doctor. You turn off the TV before the anchor says her name. Though you never really talked after the Speedwell incident, you can't help but feel that your universe is a little smaller without Lenore Strauss in it.\n\nYou are now alone.\n\nThe End\n"
"""Don't let it eat you.""","""Thanks,"" she says. She leaves the mess hall. You hear her break out into a run, her footsteps echoing through the hall.\n\n""Help!"" she shrieks as she runs. ""Help!""\n\nTime passes painfully, slowly. Finally, Salvucci turns to both of you. ""We go. Now.""\n\nAll of you start running toward the hanger. ""Keep an eye out for anything,"" Salvucci says. ""It might try to use this plan against us.""\n\nYou reach the hanger in two minutes. You all peek through the threshold to see Markie advancing on a bloodied Strauss, who has her back to the hanger door. The captain's pistol lay on the floor several feet from the pair.\n\n""She's wounded,"" Meat says, defeated. ""Infected.""\n\nMarkie is shuffling closer, giggling. Strauss sees the three of you. She looks over at the panel that controls the hanger door and then looks back at you all. She nods.\n\nYou slowly raise your pistol. Markie grabs the doctor by the throat and lifts her into the air. She chokes her.\n\nMeat raises his rifle. His hands are shaking.\n\n1. [[Mercy kill Strauss first.]]\n2. [[Go ahead and shoot the switch.]]"

"""Yes.""","""Me too, me too."" That's all he says on the matter. The week passes. He leaves. His wife, Rhonda, calls you a month later later to tell you he passed away in his sleep. You can't make the funeral because traveling would make your ailing health even worse.\n\nYou wait. You spend days watching old movies. You try to make your way through a collection of Christine Love's works, but you keep losing your focus.\n\nDeath comes when you're sitting in your loveseat watching a news report on a bridge being built in a neighboring county. It is a quick, painful tremor that starts in your chest and spreads out.\n\nThe dark sets in. You never expected slipping away to be this easy.\n\n\nThe End\n"
"""That's good and all, but what about Markie?""","We have to euthanize her,"" Strauss says, looking through the glass at Markie. ""The infection could spread.""\n\n""I thought you chopped her damn arm off so that wouldn't happen.""\n\n""The possibility of infection still remains and, as I'm sure Julia can attest to, officer Daniels has only worsened in the past half hour. I'd say there's at least a fifty percent chance that what happened to the arm will happen to her.""\n\n""That thing was bad enough, captain,"" Ben says. ""It took three rounds to kill it.""\n\n""We have no idea what kind of beast she'll devolve into—""\n\n""If she turns in the first place. God damn it.

Through the window you watch the beast lift its massive foot above Strauss' head and then bring it down, snapping her neck.\n\nAnd then the viewport finally shatters, sucking both the monster and Strauss' corpse into space. An alarm blares for a couple of seconds before the emergency panel closes over the viewport.\n\nYou breathe a sigh of relief. You're alive. You won.\n\nYour body aches, but you have one last thing to do before you can enter the cryochamber. You don't know how to make a molotov cocktail, so you go around the ship in search of bodies.

"Onward to Sickbay.","The room is still in the same state it was earlier.

If you see her, just yell. We'll be right outside the door.""\n\n""Yeah, got it.""\n\nYou leave him inside.\n\n""You know it's fucked up what we're doing to him, right?""

AND SHE HAS A TAIL.""\n\nThe three of you burst into the room to find Neil backing away from the examination table upon which Markie stands. Her eyes are red and where her left arm should be there's a giant, purple claw. She hisses at all of you.\n\n""Guys! Guns!"" Neil screams, cowering. ""Shoot her!""\n\n""Fire!"" Salvucci roars. You unleash a hail of bullets that knocks her off the table, but she brushes it off and stands, grinning to reveal a toothless mouth.\n\n""Fuck"" Meat says. ""Clip's dry."" Your mag is empty as well.\n\n""I've got two left,"" says Salvucci.\n\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see a ruptured hose slowly filling the room with the same gas used to operate your cryostasis chambers.\n\n1.

Giant footsteps.\n\n""Let's go.""\n\nYou both retreat to the hanger.\n\n""Shit,"" he says as the door slides shut behind you.

Hurry, it can't be far behind us.""\n\nYou deactivate the locks on the droids and catch the suit that Meat throws you. You're just about to put the helmet on when you hear the clanging on the door.\n\n""It's here. When it gets in front of the droids, shoot the hanger switch, okay? And for fuck's sake, hold on to something.""\n\nThe door bursts open and flies across the hanger. In steps the monster, mouth stained with blood, eyes looking about wildly.\n\nIt takes a step toward you.\n\n""Over here, motherfucker!"" Meat shouts through his suit's comm.\n\nIt growls and moves toward Meat. Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall. He grabs onto a wall-railing.\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n""Do it, do it now.""\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he's behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n""Hold on!""\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they're pulled as well.  \n\nA moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster's fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm. You can't help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n""We did it,"" Meat says. ""We fucking did it.""\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly. You both laugh.\n\n""We're alive!""\n\n1.[[""Home. Let's get the fuck home.""]]\n"

One day you see a report about Earth destructing. ""An issue with the core,""  says the handsome anchor. No one mentions monsters. No mentions of nukes or fleets of war crusiers. It stirkes you that no one will ever know the sacrifices of you or your crew. You weep and Michelle asks what's wrong.\n\nYou lie. Just as you do when she asks you about the augmentations. Accident in the cryotube, you tell her.\n\nYou're so wracked with guilt over these lies that you make it a priority to never lie to her about anything. For the most part, your relationship is one built on trust.\n\nThree years after your return to Mars you're married. It's a simple ceremony. Your parents show up, as do the surviving members of your crew. You eat cake. You kiss.\n\nMichelle moves in with you. You live a comfortable life together. She starts talking about children and you make efforts to put off that conversation for as long as possible.\n\nOne day, the two of you take a trip to the recently terraformed beach. There's a moment where you're looking out across the manufactured ocean of Mars. You know the ocean is fake, but you can't help but admire its beauty. This is your new life, you tell youself. It's one you've made for yourself, and you've earned every second of it.\n             \nThe End\n"
"Shoot the viewport.","You unload your clip into the window. On the fourth shot you hear a sucking sound. \n\nBingo.\n\nThe doctor leaps back behind the door's threshold. You smash the button and the emergency door comes down between the two of you and the beast. It wastes no time in striking at the door with its tentacles. You watch through the glass in the door as the viewport's glass cracks, shatters, and is sucked into space. The monster, though it tries to cling to the inside of the ship with its appendages, isn't far behind.\n\n""We did it,"" Strauss says, relieved. The alarms blare for a few minutes until the emergency panel comes down and covers where the viewport was.\n\nThe door in front of you lifts, giving you access to the rest of the ship again.\n\n""I guess we should burn the other bodies.

"Run.","You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He's a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body's back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren't far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Strauss and Meat are looking over the bloody hole in Neil's chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil's mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I'm so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn't fast enough...""\n\n""Stop talking, sweetie,"" Strauss says, taking you by surprise with the earnest care in her voice as she examines the wound. ""An artery's been pierced.""\n\n""Shit, is there anything you can do for him?""\n\nStrauss looks at you both, clearly not wanting to give her answer in front of Neil. You feel a tap on your arm. Neil looks up at you.\n\n""Julia...Julia, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is..."" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I.'

"""When I wake up, I expect to have kickass robo-limbs.""","Meat smiles and closes the pod. A moment exists between when the gas floods your chamber and when you wake up in a hospital bed on an army base in New Austin. A brief, dark moment.\n\n""Hello, Julia, your doctor says with a friendly smile. ""We took the liberty of installing your augmentations while you were under a delayed cryo release,"" she says. She has pretty eyes, and she's blonde. You were always a sucker for blondes.\n\nSome suits come by a day later and ask you for your official account of what happened aboard the Speedwell. You tell them everything, although you feel like a loony. They thank you for your time and leave you to rest.\n\nLess than a week later, you're released from the care unit. The doctor comes to visit you to perform a final checkup.\n\n1. [[Ask her for her name.]]\n2. [[Thank her for taking care of you.]]"
"""I will.""","When you get inside your house, you finally allow yourself to break down and cry. For the dead, for you, for Strauss.\n\nIt takes years for you to come to terms with the fact that you're alive. You see a therapist to help you cope with the nightmares and PTSD episodes. You are reassigned to a boring job as an analyst, an occupation you're fine with. You never marry, though you do have a series of healthy relationships with their ups and downs.\n\nTwenty years later, Strauss sends you an email out of the blue; ""I'm sorry"" is all it says. The next morning the local news reports the suicide of a renowned doctor. You turn off the TV before the anchor says her name. Though you never really talked after the Speedwell incident, you can't help but feel that your universe is a little smaller without Dr. Lenore Strauss in it.\n\nYou are now alone.\n\nThe End"
"Sacrifice yourself for humanity.","You awaken in sickbay. Meat is standing over you, a relieved expression on his face. You realize your holster's empty; your pistol is gone.\n\n""Good, we were worried you weren't gonna wake up. You hit your head pretty hard there.""\n\nYou feel your forehead. There's a bandage. ""Yeah, between Neil and I we managed to get that on your forehead. Nasty cut. Probably should get the doctors to look at it when get back to Mars.""\n\nYou eye the pistol in his holster and then look up into his eyes.

""It's the Bionic Woman! Barkeep! I'm buying all this lady's drinks tonight.""\n\nYou take a seat next to him at the table.

"""Let's head to the barracks.""","""All right, let's head that way,"" the captain says.\n\nThe four of you make your way to the barracks.

However, you can't bring yourself to eat a bullet. You've been through too much. You decide to ride it out, see what happens.\n\nNothing good. Your fingernails fall off first. Then you start vomiting and shitting blood. Your teeth are next. At this point you decide that killing yourself is the best course of action, but you go blind before you can find your gun.\n\nDays pass like this, with you lying on the floor, begging for death, unable to see anything. Finally, you feel a movement in your chest. A tremor.\n\nAnd then you feel nothing at all.\n\nThe End.\n"
"""Don't get yourself killed, doc.""","""Will try,"" she says and then takes off running, screaming her head off.\n\n""Five minutes,""  Salvucci says. ""That's all we give her.""\nMeat nods. Her footsteps (and screams) trail away. \n\nAfter three minutes, Salvucci says ""She's had enough time. Let's go.""\n\nThe three of you run down the hall to sickbay. She's inside, screwing a hose onto a black machine of some sort. She looks up. ""I told you to give me mor--""\n\nShe's interrupted by Markie's descent from the ventilation shaft onto the examination table. She growls at all of you.

"""Sleep tight, bitches.""","You slide into your chamber and the hatch closes. You quickly fall into slumber. When you wake up, you're surounded by soldiers.

You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nJust as Meat said, men in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, and Salvucci meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in almost complete silence, only uttering the names of the lost from time to time.\n\nYou all take seperate cabs home. When you reach your house in the suburbs, you pass your mailbox but decide to check it later. It's only when you swipe your card against the door's reader and hear it unlock that you feel as though you are truly safe. Inside, you shut the door and hang up your coat.\n\nYou go into the living room and sit on the couch. You do nothing but stare at the wall for hours, in a trance of sorts. You rub you finger up and down one of the cushions of your couch. You are alive to do this, but you're not sure you're thankful for that.\n\nYou begin to see a therapist. You make progress--according to him, anyway. You never really shake the memories of your time aboard the Speedwell, but you're able to cope with them.\n\nThat's more than can be said for Captain Salvucci, who eats a bullet on the third anniversary of your return to Mars. \n\nYou don't go to the funeral.\n\nYou and Meat stay in contact but the emails you send one another are largely bullshit. Your failure to connect with him is indicative of your relationship with the rest of humankind. You never marry or even begin what you're comfortable calling a relationship with anyone. For the first ten years or so, this bothers you but you slowly grow comfortable with this new you.\n\nYou become a writer. Your sci-fi espionage novels sell well enough for you to live comfortably by yourself and away from everyone.

When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner, and his face goes pale. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci's leg and tearing away flesh and muscle. Salvucci is against the cockpit's door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is on the ground next to him.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n""Conserve the ammo,"" Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben's neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate's skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben's youthful face glares at you. The thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He's closing in.\n\n""Well don't just stand there—shoot him!""\n\nYou aim down the sight of your pistol.\n\n1. [[Pull the trigger.]]"

Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\n\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there's no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where's she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie's drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it's just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What's she saying?""]]\n2.[[""What is that?""]]\n\n"
"Space it.","""Hanger it is then,"" Meat says.\n\n""One of us needs to lead it there,"" Strauss says. ""Play wounded. Beg for help. The others have to hang back otherwise it won't fall for the trick.""\n\n""I don't like this,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Me neither, but she ain't wrong,"" Meat says grimly. ""Somebody's got to be ready to put it all on the line for this.""\n\n""I'll go,"" Strauss says.\n\nMeat doesn't contain his shock. ""What?""\n\n""I think we've already established I'm helpless, which means that thing has too. It'll come running.""\n\n""This is fucking crazy. Cap, we can't send her out there. I'll go,"" Meat says.\n\n""You're the biggest of us. It won't go after you, not until it's killed everyone else off. It has to be me.""\n\nSalvucci furrows his brow. He unholsters his pistol and hands it to Strauss. ""I want my gun back, doctor. Be careful.""\n\n""Yes sir.""\n\n""Five minutes and then we're coming after you,"" Meat says.\n\nShe nods.\n\n1. [[""Be careful.""]]\n2. [[""Better you than me.""]]\n\n"
"""Nice job, shrimp. Didn't think you had it in you.""","""Thanks,"" he utters, looking away from you.\n\n""What about Markie,"" Meat asks.\n\n""We have to euthanize her,"" Strauss says, looking through the glass at Markie. ""The infection could spread.""\n\n""I thought you chopped her damn arm off so that wouldn't happen.""\n\n""The possibility of infection still remains and, as I'm sure Zoe can attest to, officer Daniels has only worsened in the past half hour. I'd say there's at least a fifty percent chance that what happened to the arm will happen to her.""\n\n""That thing  was bad enough, captain,"" Ben says. ""It took three rounds to kill it.""\n\n""We have no idea what kind of beast she'll devolve into—""\n\n""If she turns in the first place. God damn it. This is a fucking human being we're talking about.""\n\n""Keep your cool, Travis,"" Salvucci commands. \n\n""Captain, if she turns into something, I'm not sure we'll be able to contain it. Protocol states—""\n\n""To hell with your protocol! That's Markie we're talking about. And you said it's a fifty percent chance. That ain't a sure thing. Not by a long shot.""\n\n""Do you really want to bet everyone's lives on a single coin toss?""\n\n""Let's just keep her in the cube until something happens, then we decide what to do with her. I've got my rifle. Everybody else has pistols.""\n\n""Yes, because an assault rifle worked wonders for Sergeant Benson, didn't it?""\n\nMeat glares at Strauss but she continues.\n\n""Mark my words, if we don't take care of that thing, it's going to take care of us.""\n\nThe conversation is becoming heated. The captain seems uncertain what to do. You grip the pistol in your hand more tightly.\n\n1.[[""Calm your tits, everybody.""]]\n2. [[Kill Markie.]]"
"""You know what we have to do.""","He sighs. ""I know. I'll just, god..god damn it, just give me a second to set a course for the sun.""\n\nYou watch as he presses some buttons on the console and turns to you.\n\n""So, how do you want to do thi--"" he's only begun to show fear when you shoot him in the face. He flops to the floor. You carefully step past him and look out into the darkness of space.\n\nYou realize the few loved ones you have at home will never know what happened to you. You will die a mystery. You put the gun to your temple and pull the trigger.\n\nSeveral month later, the Speedwell tries to fly into the heart of the sun and is vaporized. \n\nThe End"
"""Not a damn clue.""","He sighs. ""We need to find the doctor...if she's not dead.""\n\n1.[[""Don't talk like that, cap.""]]\n2.[[""She's meat.""]]\n"
"""Why didn't you?""","""Just not worth it. They haven't come for us in two weeks. They're not going to come at all. What's the point of staying alive five days longer, y'know?""\n\nThose are the last words he says to you. He goes to sleep later and doesn't wake up. You stare at his pale body sprawled out on the floor. Your belly rumbles weakly.\n\n1. [[Resort to cannibalism.]]\n2. [[Starve.]]"
"""You okay, cap?""","""They're all dead because of me,"" he says quietly. ""I've never had people die under my command before. It's a strange feeling.""\n\n1.[[""It's not your fault.""]]\n2.[[""Move past it or more people are going to die.""]]\n"
"Get a drink with Strauss","""Thanks,"" she says quietly. You get a cab and tell him to take you to the nearest bar. There, the two of you sit in silence for at least an hour sipping your drinks. Finally, Strauss speaks.\n\n""I killed the captain. I let Ben die.""\n\n1. [[""You did.""]]\n2. [[""You only did what you had to.""]]"
"Shoot them.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n""Come on!"" Meat roars. ""This isn't a fight we can win.""\n\nYou both retreat. ""Neil,"" he yells into the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" Neil replies.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You've covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n""Markie,"" Meat says, ""where's Ryan?""\n\nShe stutters. ""D...d..dead.""\n\n""Fuck!"" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie. Her arm is wounded.\n\n1.[[""Are you okay?""]]\n2. [[Remain silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.]]\n"
"""I saw something.""","Before the words can leave your mouth, there's a whooshing sound, followed by a giant spike tearing through Ryan's chest, splattering the cave with red. Ryan's pistol drops to the floor. He moans. \n\nYou cast your light on the protruding spike and realize, as your comrade is slowly being lifted in the air, that it's a limb of some sort.\n\nMarkie's voice barks over the comm. ""Julia! What's happening? Ryan's vitals are dropping."" You fire several shots into the darkness. One of them slaps into Ryan's arm; his blue eyes gaze at you in shock.\n\nMeat now: ""Julia? Answer us, girl. What the fuck is going on?""\n\n1.[[""Get the Speedwell here now!""]]\n2.[[""We've got to go!""]]\n3.[[""Something's got Ryan!""]] \n"
"Save Strauss.","You fire at the tentacle wrapped around Strauss' neck. The appendage snaps and she falls to the floor, gasping for breath. You run by and grab her arm, pulling her to her feet. The two of you run past the creature as it focuses its attention on Meat, who cries ""Don't leave me!""\n\nAs the two of you sprint down the hallway, you can hear his screams echo down the hallway. \n\nYou and Strauss stop when she runs out of breath.\n\n""Why did you save me?"" she asks.\n\n1.[[""Not even a simple 'thanks?'""]]\n"
"Nod at him.","He smiles. The cab pulls away and you walk past your box—you'll get the mail later—and inside your home.\nThe door slides shut. And that's when you fall apart. You crumble to the floor and bawl yourself to sleep. You wake hours later only to cry yourself asleep again.\n\nWhen you wake up, you want to believe it's a new day but you can still feel the weight of the dead on your shoulders. It's a weight you never learn to completely shake, but you grow accustomed to it all: the night terrors, the sudden flashes of Ben dying in agony.\n\nMeat's friendship and an ungodly amount of therapy helps you get through the trauma, as does Melissa, the barista who becomes your wife. The military sticks you with an analyst position, something you're quite fine with, though it is boring work.\n\nYou grow older. Melissa talks about having kids.\n\n1. [[Have kids.]]\n2. [[Don't have kids.]]\n"
"""Okay, what about the hanger?""","""Space. You want to jettison the fucker. That's insane. He's slow though, so maybe it could work.""\n\n1.[[""What else are we going to do?""]]\n\n\n\n"
"""Serves you right.""","""Please hurry,"" she begs. ""We're in the cockpit.""\n\n""Hustle people,"" Meat says, breaking out into a sprint.\n\nYou and Neil follow. \n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci's leg and tearing away flesh and muscle.  Salvucci is against the cockpit's door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is next to his body.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n""Conserve the ammo,"" Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben's neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate's skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben's youthful face glares at you. The thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest.  Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He's closing in.\n\n""Well don't just stand there—shoot him!"" Neil screams.\n\nYou aim down the sight.\n\n1. [[Fire the gun.]]\n\n"
"""Ben said she was chased into the hallway.""","""Meat, you go check on Neil. Zoe and I are going to look for Strauss.""\n\n""What should we do about them? They might, y'know, come back.""\n\n""Knock that horror movie shit off, Travis.""\n\n""Captain, with all due respect, I think we're pretty well entrenched in horror movie territory right about now, oh with the crazy alien women and two dead crew members. Is it too much to humor me when I ask for a little reassurance?""\n\nSalvucci frowns. ""What are you suggesting?""\n\nMeat looks down at the corpses. ""I need oil. We can use the lab's emergency coolant system to control the blaze.""\n\nSalvucci nods solemnly. ""Run to engineering. Grab what you need. Burn the bodies.""\n\n1.[[""Are you two serious? This is insane!""]]\n2.[[""Burn 'em.""]]"
"""We sleep.""","""What about the bodies? Do you think Strauss will come back?""\n\n1.[[""Burn her just to be sure.""]]\n2.[[""She won't.""]]"
"""Your boyfriend's toast.""","Strauss closes her eyes and momentarily bites her lip. ""I'm a coward.""\n\nSalvucci holsters his gun. ""There's nothing you could have done, doctor. Let's go.""\n\nStrauss looks up, her remorse stowed away or perhaps an illusion. ""What about the creature?""\n\n""Meat's burning the bodies.""\n\nHer eyes widen. ""Why the everliving hell is that lumbering mountain of idiocy doing such a thing?""\n\n""He thinks they might come back.""\n\n""That fucking moron! We don't know how that infection works. It could be twice as deadly as an airborne virus. I need those bodies intact. Call him! Stop him!""\n\nSalvucci's face goes pale. ""I don't have a walkie.""\n\n""Run,"" she says.\n\nAnd you do. As fast as you can. Inside sickbay you find Meat, sitting down on the floor, staring at where the bodies should be, but instead there's only a lot of blood and some meaty chunks.\n\nAn oil can, a bottle, and a rag are next to Meat.\n\n""Where are they?""  Strauss demands. ""The bodies? Where are they?""\n\n""Oh good. You're alive,"" Meat says. You can feel the force of his eyeroll from here.\n\n""Where are the bodies? Did you burn them?""\n\n""No, doctor. As you would have gathered from the lack of smoke if you weren't a nutcase, I have not burned a damn thing. I came back and they were gone.""\n\nStrauss approaches Meat, gets in his face. ""Well did they just fucking get up and walk off?""\n\nHe yells back. ""I don't know! You're supposed to be the doctor here.""\n\n""Everyone relax,"" Salvucci says, voice raised.  Meat and Strauss calm down, each refusing to look at the other, each saying nothing.\n\n""We've got two missing bodies, possibly infected and mutated into hostile lifeforms."" Salvucci rubs his forehead. ""I need thoughts, suggestions, anything. Where should we go from here?"" He turns to you first. \n\n1.[[""Let's go see Neil.""]]\n2.[[""I'm ready to go hunting.""]]"
"""Come on. Let's sleep, then.""","""Best goddamn thing I've heard on this stupid voyage. Let's go.""\n\nYou both head to the cryogenics room and ready your pods. They hiss and spew cold air on you as they open.\n\n""Two months,"" he says as he stares at the tube, which you realize now looks very much like a coffin. ""Here's hoping nothing eats us while we're sleeping.""\n\nHe gets in his. You follow suit.\n\n""See you soon, lady.""\n\nYou press the button on the interior door and it slowly closes on your tube. You hear the seal clamp. A mist falls over your face.\n\nYou slowly closes your eyes and desperately hope you wake up.\n\nIt's as though no time passes between the moment the darkness falls over you to when you open your eyes again to see ten soldiers standing over you, peering down, each of them equipped with assault rifles.\n\n""Come on, lieutenant,"" one of them says, lifting you to your feet. You see Meat being held up by two soldiers. He's grinning like a fool.\n\n""We did it,"" his eyes say.\n\nThe troops escort you both to your own personal rooms where you're served cheap stake and soda pop. It tastes superb. Later, you and Meat are interviewed about the incident aboard the Speedwell. You both answer the interviewer, an older man with a bald spot, as honestly as you can.\n\nAnd then he shows you security footage of you and Meat killing Strauss.\n\n""Explain,"" he says. Before you can even say anything, Meat jumps in. ""The bitch murdered the captain. She would have killed us too. You bet I fucking killed her.""\n\nAnd just like that, his confession damns you. You're both court-martialed. You both get life.\n\nYou live within the walls of Titan penitentiary for 22 more years. On the first day in prison, another woman tries to force herself on you in the showers, a shank in her hand. The guards find her later with the makeshift blade buried in her eye; her tongue has been removed and placed next to her.\n\nEventually, the other inmates come to respect you enough that you become the most powerful person in the prison. You can get almost anything you want: TVs, movies, games, gourmet food. Sometimes someone says something disrespectful; you are ruthless in dispatching them. Everyone and everything is your property.\n\nIn the twenty-second year of your reign, another upstart conspires to have you murdered. She posions a pie later brought to your cell. You die alone, reaching toward the ceiling as your insides are burned away.\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n"
"Shoot him too.","You shoot Neil as well. His corpse falls to the floor. His lifeless eyes look up at you in confusion.\n\nWhat now?\n\n1. [[End your life.]]\n2. [[Wait.]]\n"
"""I'm fine.""","He looks away sheepishly. ""Sorry.""\n\n""Stop trying to hit that, Ryan. It's not gonna happen,"" says Markie, the Speedwell's science officer.\n\nRyan waves his hand dismissively.\n\nThe enforcer of the group, Meat, chuckles. ""She told you.""\n\n1.[[Nudge Markie and give her a wink of gratitude.]]\n"
"""We fucked things up for you. I'm sorry.""","Neil nods at you one last time. You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I'll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nStrauss follows Meat. You look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Strauss and Meat, he's already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. Meat grabs Strauss and pulls her through.You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. Strauss looks on sadly.\n\n1.[[""Hey! Focus. I need you here. We can stew in our guilt later, got that?""]]\n2. [[Leave him be.]]"
"You don't have kids.","You and Jack choose not to have kids. You never regret the choice, and Jack doesn't seem to either, though you do wonder what your life would be like if you had children.\n\nYou make enough money to retire. You grow old and stop shaving your legs because who gives a fuck? Jack's hair goes white first. Yours follows shortly. You decide not to get anti-aging treatments. \n\nYou wake up one morning to find your husband cold on the patio. You get down on the floor and hold his corpse for hours before you finally dial the operator and tell the poor man on the other end that your husband is dead and you have no clue what to do. He takes your address and promises he'll send an ambulance.\n\nThey come. Your heart shatters when they zip him in a bag.\n\nLater, weeks after the funeral, Meat comes to stay for a couple of weeks. He's bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg. You watch reruns of Farscape: The Next Story and play chess. You talk of your loved ones.  Then, he brings it up: ""Do you ever think of them? The crew?""\n\n1. [[""I do.""]]\n2. [[""I don't.""]]\n3. [[""What's the point?""]]"

It's not right at all.""\n\n""Just give me your damn gun, dude."" He coughs. Meat, with reluctance, takes the pistol from his holster and sticks it in Neil's hand. He then goes from stove to stove, turning on the gas.\n\nAnother bang at the door. The tip of a tentacle pierces the door and writhes wildly about, slapping a nearby wall.\n\n""Go,"" Neil says, fighting to stay conscious.\n\n1.[[""I'm so sorry, Neil.""]]\n2. [[Don't say anything to him.]]\n"
"""What's the use?""","""I dream of them from time to time,"" he says. ""I miss them."" \n\nThat's all he says on the matter. The week passes. He leaves. His wife, Rhonda, calls you a month later to tell you he passed away in his sleep. You can't make the funeral because traveling would make your ailing health even worse.\n\nYou wait. You spend days watching old movies. You try to make your way through a collection of Christine Love's works, but you keep losing your focus.\n\nDeath comes when you're sitting in your loveseat watching a news report on a bridge being built in a neighboring county. It is a quick, painful tremor that starts in your chest and spreads out.\n\nThe dark sets in. You never expected slipping away to be this easy.\n\nThe End"
"""She was infected; she killed Meat.""","""God,"" Salvucci says, holstering his weapon.\n\n""And then there were three,"" Neil says.\n\n""We're probably infected too,"" Salvucci says quietfully.\n\n""But there's been no symptoms yet.""\n\n""What if they never show up until years later? When we're back on Mars.""\n\n""Then a doctor could take care of us or something, man.""\n\nYou see Salvucci slowly reach for his pistol again. ""I can't take that risk.

"Go eat something.","The mess hall is rather small: two tables next to an enclosed kitchen. You find Meat sitting at by himself, shoveling ramen into his mouth. A plastic cup filled with cheap whiskey is next to his arm. You grab your favorite snack, baked potato chips, and take a seat.\n\nMeat looks up at you, eyes red, a weary expression.\n\n""Hell of a day, huh? Poor Ryan. How's Markie? How are you?""\n\n1.[[""Strauss is taking her freakin' arm off.""]]\n2.[[""Cut the shit. You know how my day's been.""]]\n\n"
"Improvise.","Without a word to your companions, you dash across the room and grab the hose. The freezing gas pours over your pants and chest. The cold nearly makes you drop the hose--it's like you've fallen into freezing water.\n\nMarkie makes a beeline for you. You lock eyes with Salvucci. Luckily, he understands and raises his pistol.\n\nYou brace yourself as Markie slams into you. Both of you fall to the ground, the hose pointed upward into the chest of the creature. The monster unleashes a hellish scream as you push up as hard as you can. The hose hisses. \n\nYou hear Meat yell something. And then a loud pop. A weight is lifted off your chest as Markie falls to the right, but you know not to let up: you aim the hose to the right. Through the mist, you see her flailing about.\n\nSomething grabs you and forces you to let go of the hose. It drags you away to the corner of the room. You feel cold inside. Every breath hurts...and your hand feels lighter. \n\nThrough blurred vision, you watch as Salvucci approaches Markie, each footsteep dispelling the mist, and points his sidearm down at her face. He fires, shattering her hideous, frozen visage.\n\nYou did it: she's dead.\n\n""Captain!"" Meat yells, he's looking down at you, eyes filled with panic. ""Get over here.""\n\nSleep takes you.\n\n1. [[Awaken.]]\n\n"
"""I don't think so, Meat.""","He sighs. ""I want to believe you, but...nevermind. What now?""\n\n1.[[""We sleep.""]]\n\n"
"Look into her eyes as she dies.","You stare into her eyes as the life is choked out of her by your companion. She reaches for you helplessly but then her arm goes limp.\n\n""Dude, stop!"" Neil yells, but Meat doesn't. A minute later, Strauss has stopped moving altogether. The light's gone out of her eyes. Meat lets her corpse drop to the floor. \n\nNeil moans in horror. ""Travis...""\n\n""She would have killed us, man; the moment she saw any of us as a threat, she would have killed as without a thought, just to save her sorry hide. Good riddance.""\n\nMeat lights up his molotov and throws it atop Ben and the captain's corpses.\n\n""So, uh, what do we do now?"" Neil asks after a long bout of silence.\n\n""We're not done hunting, Neil.""\n\n""With what? You saw what bullets did to Ben: took a whole damn clip and then some.""\n\n""We'll have to improvise, won't we?

""Figured as much.""\n\nThe PA clicks on: ""All officers report to sickbay,"" Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his food and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you're out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nThe door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube. She's looking around wildly.\n\nYou smell gunsmoke. Ben has both of his hands wrapped around his pistol.\n\n1.[[""Why weren't we invited to the party?""]]\n2.[[""Something happened, huh?""]]"
"""Guess we should go investigate, eh?""","""Fuck that!"" Meat says, turning. He aims his assault rifle at the first speaker and dismembers it with a single shot. He takes the second and third speakers out of commission as well. The music is no longer overpowering, but you can hear its echoes in the hallway.\n\n""Brutal, but effective,"" Strauss comments.\n\nSalvucci frowns. ""You're footing the bill for that when we get back.""\n\n""Guys, now that Zoe is awake, I think we should talk strategy. I just finished with our travel projections..."" Neil says.\n\n""And?"" Strauss says, as though she knows what's coming next.\n\n""Well, it's like you said, doc: not good. Two months to Mars.""\n\n""We could last that long,"" Salvucci says. ""We ration food, ammo, go in groups to the rest of the ship when we need supplies.""\n\n""Captain, permission to speak?"" Meat says.\n\nSalvucci nods.\n\n""That's a horrible idea. We've got guns. Why don't we use them? For all we know, that beastie thing could be growing. We need to hunt it down and kill it now.""\n\n""Travis, I put a gun against Markie's head and blew her brains all over the floor. Apparently the thing inside her shook it off and walked away. I don't think bullets are going to save us.""\n\n""Then we destroy the body completely,"" Meat suggests. ""Shoot it, stomp it, burn it, and then jettison the motherfucker into space.""\n\n""Captain, I don't like either choice, but I think the more cautious one would be eliminating its presence from the ship,"" Strauss says slowly.\n\n""Didn't you say something about it being airborne?"" Salvucci asks. ""Could killing it infect one of us?""\n\nStrauss sighs, shrugs. ""There's no way to be sure. I didn't get to run any tests on it. However, I'd rather take a chance on that possibility than risk us starving ourselves into easy prey.""\n\nSilence fills the common room. Then—\n\n""What do you think, Zoe?""

Meat says as you and he make your way to the kitchen door.\n\n""I can't believe this shit.""\n\nYou and Meat step into the kitchen and move away from the door. He turns to you. ""Make sure you have your gun ready, okay? I don't want Neil to get eaten because we ran dry.""\n\nYou check your pistol to make sure it has a full clip and nod.\n\nYou both silently and listen to Neil in the other room. ""Please help me,"" you hear him beg. ""I can't find you guys.""\nThis goes on for 20 whole minutes, Neil's acting growing steadily worse. ""I fucking hurt my leg,"" he whimpers.\n\n""He's clearly never taken a drama class,"" Meat says.\n\n""Oh fuck,"" Neil says urgently. \n\n1. [[Give Meat the walkie.]]\n"

Giant footsteps.\n\n""Let's go.""\n\nYou both retreat to the hanger.\n\n""Shit,"" he says as the door slides shut behind you.

Hurry, it can't be far behind us.""\n\nYou deactivate the locks on the droids and catch the suit that Meat throws you. You're just about to put the helmet on when you hear the clanging on the door.\n\n""Shit. It's here. When it gets in front of the droids, shoot the hanger switch, okay?

"Talk to Strauss and Salvucci.","Salvucci is talking when you head over. You can see that Strauss is smiling, but it's a sad smile.\n\n""She was a strong individual,"" Salvucci says. ""I've had her on four voyages. One time, three years back, we were all on Jupiter at the hanger and everyone was boarding, and this guy sets off the detector. He opens his shirt and reveals enough explosives to decimate every person in the hanger. Meat, Me, couple of others have got out guns trained on him, but Markie–-she talked him down. She saw what nobody else saw: he was just a stupid kid gripped in the thrall of some fundamentalist nonsense. She saved at least one life that day, probably more.""\n\n""She was a good solider,"" Strauss says sadly.\n\n1.[[""You bet your ass she was.""]]\n2.[[""It's pretty funny, you saying that, when you were ready to pull her down a couple of hours ago.

Don't like it whatever it is.""\n\nThe whine again. You focus your eyes and see something moving in the dark.\n\nMeat sees it, too. He fires at it. As muzzle flash fills the cave with brief spells of light you see that the creature isn't one thing, but many things with feelers and sharp teeth.\n\nThey rush toward you, hundreds of them.\n\n""Let's get out of here!"" Meat yells.\n\n1. [[Shoot them.]]\n2. [[Run away.]]"
"""Nice job, Ben.""","""Thanks,"" he utters, looking away from you.\n\n""What about Markie?"" Meat asks.\n\nWe have to euthanize her,"" Strauss says, looking through the glass at Markie. ""The infection could spread.""\n\n""I thought you chopped her damn arm off so that wouldn't happen.""\n\n""The possibility of infection still remains and, as I'm sure Julia can attest to, officer Daniels has only worsened in the past half hour.

""It took three rounds to kill it.""\n\n""We have no idea what kind of beast she'll devolve into—""\n\n""If she turns in the first place. God damn it.

"Mess hall","""Mess hall it is.""\n\nThe four of you proceed carefully through the hallways of the ship.\n\n""Hey, should we be worried about the pilot?""

Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open.  \n\nInside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you—-his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there's no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. She's delerious now, stumbling. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""I dunno. I think the blood on Markie's suit isn't all hers, though.""\n\n""Damn it, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where's she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  \n\nYou glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie's drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it's just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.

"Don't have kids.","You and Melissa choose not to have kids. Well, actually, you're the one who chooses not to and she never makes too much of a fuss about it, though you think she resents you for it.\n\nYou make enough money to retire. You grow old and stop shaving your legs, because who gives a fuck? Melissa's hair goes white first. Yours follows shortly. You decide not to get anti-aging treatments. \n\nYou wake up one morning to find your wife cold on the kitchen floor. You get down on the floor and hold her corpse for hours before you finally call the operator and tell the poor man on the other end that your wife is dead and you have no clue what to do. He takes your address and promises he'll send an ambulance.\n\nThey come. Your heart shatters when they zip her up in a bag.\n\nLater, weeks after the funeral, Meat comes to stay for a couple of weeks. He's bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg.

The monster's mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattle snake.\n\nYou turn to look at Meat. He's being lifted into the air by one of the tentacles. His face turns red; he's slowly being choked to death.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Save Meat's life.]]\n2.

"Fire the gun.","You squeeze the trigger twice. Each round hits, but it doesn't even faze him. Ben opens his mouth and a moan leaks out. Almost all of his teeth are gone. This close, you can see that the iris of his remaining eye is yellow. You take aim again.\n\nSalvucci, standing on his wounded leg, beats you and Meat to the trigger.\n\nThe captain grabs Ben by the side of his face and throws him into the wall. The thing moans as it hits the floor. It's surprisingly quick to rise, but Salvucci already has the crowbar in his hand.\n\nHe grunts and brings the curved end down on the back of Ben's head hard. The monster crumbles and is hit again as it slowly lifts its head. Red and yellow matter splatter the wall—little squirts at first, but they grow larger once the back of the skull caves in.\n\nSalvucci drops the crowbar and falls back onto the floor, out of breath.\n\nMeat approaches the beast. It slowly sticks its hand out toward him, fingers crawling across the floor like a wounded spider. Meat raises his boot above the monster's head and stomps. Once. Twice. \n\nBen convulses. He goes still after the third impact. Meat steps past the body and helps Salvucci to his feet.\n\n""Cap...""

"Simply nod.","When you get inside your house, you finally allow yourself to break down and cry. For the dead, for you, for Strauss.\n\nIt takes years for you to come to terms with the fact that you're alive. You see a therapist to help you cope with the nightmares and PTSD episodes. You are reassigned to a boring job as an analyst, an occupation you're fine with. You never marry, though you do have a series of healthy relationships with their ups and downs.\n\nTwenty years later, Strauss sends you an email out of the blue; ""I'm sorry"" is all it says. The next morning the local news reports the suicide of a renowned doctor. You turn off the TV before the anchor says her name. Though you never really talked after the Speedwell incident, you can't help but feel that your universe is a little smaller without Lenore Strauss in it.\n\nYou are now alone.\n\nThe End\n"

"Go to sickbay.","The lights are off in sickbay. As you step inside a rotten smell hits you in the face. It takes all your strength not to lean over and barf.\n\n""What the hell is that?"" Meat says.\n\n""Doctor Strauss? Ben?"" Salvucci calls.\n\nThe three of you inch forward. Meat turns on the flashlight attached to his rifle. There's a giant blood smear on the wall. He gently moves the rifle around, illuminating different areas of the room.\n\n""What do you think happened?"" Meat asks.\n\nBefore you can answer, you step on something. Something squishy. Meat shines his light on it.\n\n1. [[Look down]]\n"
"""Yeah, yeah, get on with it.""","Meat smiles and closes the pod. A moment exists between when the gas floods your chamber  and when you wake up in a hospital bed on an army base in New Texas. A brief, dark moment.\n\n""Hello, Julia,"" your doctor says with a friendly smile. ""We took the liberty of installing your augmentations while you were under a delayed cryo release,"" she says. She has pretty eyes, and she's blonde. You were always a sucker for blondes.\n\nSome suits come by a day later and ask you for your official account of what happened aboard the Speedwell. You tell them everything, although you feel like a bit of a loony. They thank you for your time and leave you to rest.\n\nLess than a week later, you're released from the care unit.

"""Sleep well.""","You slide into your chamber and the hatch closes. You quickly fall into slumber. When you wake up, you're surounded by soldiers. One of them, a corporal, is saying something but his words are soundless. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, and Meat are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nJust as Meat said, men in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, and Salvucci meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in almost complete silence, only uttering the names of the lost from time to time.\n\nYou all take seperate cabs home. When you reach your house in the suburbs, you pass your mailbox but decide to check it later. It's only when you swipe your card against the door's reader and hear it unlock that you feel as though you are truly safe. Inside, you shut the door and hang up your coat.\n\nYou go into the living room and sit on the couch. You do nothing but stare at the wall for hours, in a trance of sorts. You rub you finger up and down one of the cushions of your couch. You are alive to do this, but you're not sure you're thankful for that.\n\nYou begin to see a therapist. You make progress--according to him, anyway. You never really shake the memories of your time aboard the Speedwell, but you're able to cope with them.\n\nThat's more than can be said for Captain Salvucci, who eats a bullet on the third anniversary of your return to Mars. You don't go to the funeral.\n\nYou and Meat stay in contact but the emails you send one another are largely going through the motions bullshit. You never send a word to one another that is true. Your failure to connect with him is indicative of your relationship with the rest of humankind. You never marry or even begin what you're comfortable calling a relationship with anyone. For the first ten years or so, this bothers you but you slowly grow comfortable with this new you.\n\nYou become a writer. Your sci-fi erotica, written under a pseudonym, sells well enough for you to live comfortably by yourself and away from everyone. You're mostly happy but sometimes there's a thought that strikes at like a whip.\n\nYou are alone.\n\n                    The End\n\n\n\n\n"

"""This is a plan I'm not crazy about.""","""Everything will be fine,"" Markie says.\n\nYou go your separate ways, hiking down the cliff with Meat. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel.  You step inside and can't help but feel that you're entering the dark maw of a living planet.\n\n""Let's get our lights on.""\n\nYou both tell your suits to turn your on your light attachments. Yours flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\n On the Head Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. You see that yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\nYou proceed through the cave.\n\n""You know what I want,"" Meat says. He doesn't wait for you to answer. ""I want a fucking taco. Beef. Cheese. Some guac on top. No more of this space bag food bullshit.""\n\n1. [[""Hot dogs, dude. Hot dogs.""]]"
"""Yeah. It's bullshit.""","""Man, there's something about that doctor. She likes hurting people.""\n\n1.[[""You're still angry about that time she reset your broken finger, you big baby.""]]\n2.[[""I get that vibe, too.""]]"
"Shoot the monster.","You fire your last shot in the dark. The beast roars again and then you catch a glimpse of the monster's hideous, reptilian face as it darts out and closes its jaws around Ryan's head. \n\nLike fingers plucking a grape from a vine, the beast rips out your squadmate's head, leaving a bloody stump. The squad vital monitor shrieks at you, and you flee. \n\nLooking over your shoulder, you watch as what's left of Ryan is pulled out of sight.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you eventually stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie. Behind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the dirt. You run toward your squadmates. You've covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell descending.\n\nWhen you reach them Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fires several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie's arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your empty pistol and bash the monster's dome inward. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived, as Meat puts three rounds into the soft underbelly.\n\n""Fucking fuck."" He kicks the crab.\n\nYou turn to Markie, who's holding her arm. \n\n1.[[""Your suit's ripped.""]]"
"Answer Neil.","""She's fucking here, guys. She reeks.""\n\n""Sit tight,"" Meat says. He nods at you. Both of you creep to the door. Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with perspiration. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that's not what's making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n""Stay away from me,"" Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n""Now,"" Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn't even have time to turn her head before rifle fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You're not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you. Luckily, there's not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n""Oh godfuckingshit,"" Neil yells. ""That was Markie.""\n\nStrauss emerges from the kitchen, a napkin over her mouth and nose. She takes one glance and then looks away.\n\n""So, we like win now, right? They're all dead?""\n\n""Yeah, I think—""\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie's hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump. He fires the rest of the clip into the corpse.\n\n1. [[Blast it.]]\n2. [[Run into the kitchen.]]"
"""Don't strain yourself then.""","""I don't need your sympathy, Julia. Let's just go get the pilot.""\n\nThe two of you proceed down the main hallway. The silence is heavy, and Strauss seems to be deep in her own thoughts.\n\n1.\t[[""What's waiting for you on Mars?""]]\n2.\t[[""What's up with you and Meat anyway?""]]\n\n"
"Leave the doctor to her work.","Without another word, you step into the hallway. You realize, now that you're away from the antiseptic stench of sickbay, you're hungry.\n\n1. [[Go eat.]]"
"Barracks","""All right, let's head that way,"" the captain says. The four of you make your way to the barracks. Inside, you see two rows of bunkbeds and all your personal belongings. You and Meat check underneath each bed, but there doesn't seem to any trace of the creature.\n\n""Mess hall it is,"" says Meat.\n\n1. [[Mess hall]]"
"Put your hand on his shoulder.","He stops punching the wall after a while. Blood drips from his fingers. He breathes heavy.\n\n""He's dead...because of us.""\n\n1.[[""Yeah, so let's make it count.""]]\n2.[[""Listen to me: this is not on you.""]]\n"
"""You only did what you had to.""","""I guess so. Still. I wish things could have been different.""\n\nYou sip your drinks without another word until it's time to go. The cabbie takes you home first.\n\n""Julia,"" Strauss says. ""Take care, okay?""\n\n1. [[""Thanks, doc.""]]\n2. [[""I will.""]]"
"""I didn't.""","""If it's not dead, we're fucked. All we got left is your pistol. I'm guessing you're down to two clips.""\n\nYou pop the clip out of your pistol to show him it's the last one.\n\n""Shit.""\n\n""We don't know if it's alive. If it is, we'll improvise.""\n\n""Great, I wonder who'll die next time thanks to our masterful improvisation abilities.""\n\nStrauss says nothing. \n\nA few minutes later you reach the cockpit door. Ben's body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n\n""Well, that's good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You notice that Strauss is deliberately looking away from Ben's smashed skull.\n\nThe three of you step into the cockpit. You slam the door behind you.\n\n""Here's the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you. You type in ""KONAMI.""\n\nThe screen changes to a selection of menus.\n\n""There's the autopilot,"" says Strauss. She touches the screen and selects NEW AUSTIN.""\n\n""We done?"" Meat asks.\n\n""Yeah, I think we're set.""\n\n""Good.""\n\nAll of you approach the door.\n\n""Now let's get out of here before that fucking thing corn—"" \n\nA tentacle sweeps through the door as soon as it opens and brushes all of you aside with a mighty swing. You all going flying across the room. You slam into the viewport, cracking the glass, and then fall to the floor. Looking up, you see the thing step into view: it's monstrous, with a muscular human abdomen. \n\nThe monster's face is distinctly unhuman with countless slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster's mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattlesnake.\n\n""No!"" you hear Strauss scream as one of the tentacles darts out and wraps itself around her neck.  It lifts her into the air and pulls her toward its master. You turn to look at Meat who's paralyzed with fear, watching one of the tentacles dance above him.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Save Meat.]]\n2. [[Save Strauss.]]\n3. [[Save yourself.]]\n"
"Draw it out.","""Okay, with what?"" Neil asks.\n\nThere's a moment of silence as you, Meat, and Strauss turn to look at Neil. \n\n""Oh,"" he says, getting it. ""Well fuck that.""\n\n1.[[""Don't be a baby.""]]\n2.[[""We could just knock you out.""]]\n\n\n"
"""Something happened, huh?""","""The infection spread,"" Strauss explains.\n\n""What fucking infection?"" Meat interjects.\n\nStrauss turns her cold gaze onto him. ""I don't know precisely what is in her body, Travis. What I do know is that once I amputated her arm, it lunged at my throat.""\n\n""Bullshit.""\n\n""No, it's...it's...true,"" Ben stammers. ""It's over there. Look.""\n\nThere, lying on the ground, is an arm with shriveled fingers caked in yellow ooze. You can barely make out three bullet holes.\n\n""Lenore says that Ben saved her life by putting it down,"" Salvucci explains.\n\n1.[[""What about Markie?""]]\n2.[[""Nice job, shrimp. Didn't think you had it in you.""]]"
"""Nobody could have predicted that.""","He doesn't meet your eyes and offers no reply.\n\n""He gave you a password, right?"" Strauss says. ""Maybe there's an autopilot sequence on his computer.""\n\n""Doesn't do us any good if that thing is still stomping around.""\n\n""Do you really think it survived that blast?""\n\n""Is that a serious question?""\n\n""Either way, we need to get the ship moving. Let's get to the cockpit and decide what to do there.""\n\nYou make your way toward the cockpit. About halfway there, Meat speaks. ""What was it doing when it killed Neil?""\n\n""Evolving,"" Strauss answers.\n\n""Did you get a good look at it?"" Meat asks.\n\n1.[[""I didn't.""]]\n2.[[""It had a lot of tentacles.""]]\n"
"Shoot Markie.","""Here's what we're going to do,"" Salvucci starts. \n\nThe sudden discharge of your pistol cuts him off. The first two rounds shatter the quarantine glass. You approach the cube. \n\nSomeone—Meat perhaps?—is shouting something, but it's too late. You're raising your gun, leveling it at Markie's head. She looks up at you, uncomprehending.\n\nYou fire once. A mixture of red and yellow liquid spills out of the back of her head as her body crumples. The smell is excruciating. You gag. And that's when Meat smashes the butt of his rifle into your face.\n\nYou black out.\n\nYou wake up two months later in a prison cell where Salvucci, with a mixture of sympathy and disgust hiding behind his blue eyes, explains how they put you in cryo sleep for the rest of the journey home and how now you will be brought before a military tribunal for the murder of your crewmember.\n\nHe refuses to listen when you try to explain your actions and offers you only one comfort before leaving: he hears your lawyer is pretty damn good.\n\nAnd she is. She's a looker and has a brain to match. She manages to convince the court that you committed, not murder, but manslaughter out of concern for your crew. You serve five years at Titan penitentiary and earn the good will of the prisoner population by teaching them science and mathematics, and regaling them with stories of your travels.\n\nUpon release, you can't find a job teaching at any of the universities on Mars or even the terraformed moons. Finally, a desperate temp agency takes a chance on you and you end up working as a secretary for an accounting office in New Memphis. They eventually hire you full-time and, despite being miserable, you never look for another job out of fear of rejection.\n\nEventually you get lonely and give Meat a call, hoping to reconcile. He's not there. You leave a message, but he never calls back. You have night terrors and imagine Markie's face, her yellow eyes, staring at you from the darkness. \n\nWhen you were younger, you told yourself you'd never be a cat lady, so you become a lizard lady instead. Most of your free time and fun money are dedicated to purchasing and raising as many types of reptiles as possible. The chameleon Toro is your prized pet.\n\nFinally, some fifty years after you killed Markie, you begin to feel life slip away from you. You're not sure if it's disease or depression or some form of universal comeuppance, but you let yourself go piece by piece. However, you're defiant all the way to the end. ""I did the right thing,"" you mutter to yourself. ""I saved lives."" \n\nSoon you fall into eternal rest. Your lizards are not far behind.\n\nThe End\n"
"""It might be Ben.""","""Even better,"" Meat says grimly.\n\n""Let's just shut down the computer,"" Neil says.\n\n""It's your computer. After you, your majesty.""\n\n""Oh no, you've got the gun. You go first. Please, I insist.""\n\nMeat grumbles as he steps past Neil and peers into the room. You see him flip on the light attached to the rifle.\n\n""See anything?""\n\n""No, but it's dark. There's shattered glass on the floor—probably the lights."" He creeps into the room slowly. \n\nYou and Neil follow.\n\nRemember me to the one who lives there...\n \nThe room is pitch black except for the light coming from the computer terminal next to Neil's bed. The computer, a custom built powerhouse, sits on the floor and is connected to an obnoxiously large, wall-mounted flat screen. On the screen, you see a music library. Meat flashes his light across the floor. There's at least 11 or 12 footsteps separating you and the terminal, a no-man's land of shattered glass and possible traps.\n\n""Well,"" Neil says after a moment. ""I guess one of us should cross—""\n\nGunfire cuts off Neil's sentence as Meat fires three rounds into the terminal. The music dies abruptly.\n\n""Are you fucking kidding me?!""  Neil erupts. ""That was two months worth of pay! It was like, the ultimate fucking entertainment system!""\n\nYou can't make out Meat's expression in the dark but you can tell he's not in the mood to deal with Neil's shit. ""Listen, if we get out of this alive, I'll buy you a new toy, okay?""\n\n""It was brand new!""\n\n""Shut up. Did you hear that?""\n\nYou listen. You hear nothing, not the crackling of glass, or an insidious snicker. \n\n""Let's go,"" says Meat. You all turn, and, of course, there she is, standing next to the door.\n\nNeil gasps in horror. Markie smiles at all of you, the hallway light shining on her face to reveal rotting flesh and a dangling eyeball. Her arm stump oozes yellow.\n\nMeat raises his rifle, but he's too slow. She slams the door.\n\nYou're locked in here with her.\n\n1. [[ Pull out your pistol and fire blindly.]]\n2. [[Panic and run.]]\n\n\n\n"
"""It's trying to scare us.""","""Well, we're about to put an end to that shit,"" Meat says as you approach the crew's quarters. You see large cables running through the doorway; they lead up the wall and into the ceiling.\n\nNeil reaches up and runs his hand along the cables. He quickly pulls it back. ""Augh! Fuck!""\n\n""What is it?"" Meat barks.\n\n""Nothing,"" Neil says, regaining his composure. ""Just fucking slime. Oh god, gag a maggot,"" he says. ""This shit reeks."" He holds his hand up to the light to reveal a goopy, transparent liquid.\n\n""Hey, that looks a little bit like—""\n\n""Don't you say it, Travis.""\n\nYou examine the cables without touching them.\n\nMeat takes a look as well. ""Seems like a complicated operation.""\n\n""What, turning on the computer, starting a program, and plugging in some cables?""\n\nMeat turns. ""You didn't see how feral this thing was—not to mention she's missing a goddamn arm.""\n\n1.[[""Could be Ben.""]]\n"
"""Yeah. I understand.""","""Good. Give me your gun and turn the gas on before you leave.""\n\n""There's no way out except through the front.""\n\n""Vent,"" he says, pointing at a vent near one of the stoves. ""...Gotta crawl fast. I'll give you as much time as I can.""\n\nA clanging at the door. Whatever was inside Markie is now trying to get in the kitchen.\n\n""This ain't fucking right, man. It's not right at all.""\n\n""Just give me your damn gun, dude."" He coughs. Meat, with reluctance, takes the pistol from his holster and sticks it in Neil's hand. \n\nStrauss quickly turns on all the gas stoves in the room.\n\nAnother bang at the door. The tip of a tentacle pierces the door and writhes wildly about, slapping a nearby wall.\n\n""Go,"" Neil says, fighting to stay conscious.\n\n1.[[""We fucked things up for you. I'm sorry.""]]\n2. [[Say nothing to him. Leave.]]"
"""Deal.""","""Seriously though, I wonder if we'll find anything down here.  I still think it's erosion. I mean, sure, these tunnels are uh pretty deep, I guess, but erosion can do that, right? Erosion. Yeah.""\n\nYou continue on, the darkness before you disappearing to reveal only more darkness. Your suit tells you that ten minutes have passed, but it feels like an age. Ryan's chatter isn't helping.\n\n""Hey, has Markie talked you about me at all? Actually, better question: do you know if she's dating anyone?

Yours flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\nOn the Head Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. You see that yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\nYou proceed through the cave.\n\n""You know what I want,"" Meat says.

"Push Neil out of the way and lunge at Markie.","You push Neil to the side and ram the butt of the pistol into Markie's face. Flesh and pus and blood splash your arm; the revolting stench infilitrates your nostrils. You hit Markie in the face again and again. Her blood's on your face now, in your eyes, in your mouth.\n\nThe body goes limp. You stop. And then, finally having a chance to smell what you're covered in, you vomit.\n\n""Zoe?"" Neil says tapping you on the shoulder.\n\nYou respond by throwing up some more. You're lightheaded and swaying.\n\nNeil says your name again, but you can barely hear it over the screams, a woman screaming inside your head so loud it cracks the walls of you skull and sets your synapses aflame.\n\nIt's Markie. ""Mine,"" she shrieks. ""Mine!""\n\nYou're falling. You succumb to the dark. But in that darkness, she talks to you. Her voice mingling with a deeper one, the voice of the monster. Of the thing that killed her and Ryan and Strauss and Ben.\n\nYou are mine, it says, but you're stronger than those who have come before you. I cannot break your will so easily, so I offer you an opportunity: allow what's happening to you to happen and we can achieve the destiny of my race together. You will be a legend. If you do not, we will find another way. We've slept in the chambers of your planet for your species'entire existence, waiting. The stars are our destiny--not yours.

Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster. He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there's no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship.

Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie's drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. Strauss examines the bite: it's just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What the hell is she saying?""]]\n"

He takes your address and promises he'll send an ambulance.\n\nThey come. Your heart shatters when they zip him in a bag.\n\nLater, weeks after the funeral, Meat comes to stay for a couple of weeks. He's bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg. You watch reruns of sitcoms and play chess. You talk of your loved ones and your children.

"Blast Ben.","You go for your gun, but someone beats you to the trigger. A shot tears off Ben's lower jaw, sending it flying into the wall. The second splits his forehead. The body falls back onto the floor and continues to gurgle.\n\nYou turn to see Strauss holding up the captain's pistol, tears in her eyes.\n\n""Doc,"" Meat says, but she walks past him and continues to fire round after round into the corpse. Ben goes silent and still.\n\n""Lenore,"" Salvucci says, reaching out to comfort her.\n\n""We have to burn him too,"" she says, no hint of emotion in her voice. ""Don't touch him.

""If it's airborne, we're dead anyway.""\n\n""I'll go get some oil then,"" say Meat.\n\n""And I'll check on the console in the cockpit and hope to god Neil had enough time and selflessness to set up our autopilot.

"Don't touch him","The captain and Meat continue to examine the rest of the room for clues of the creature's whereabouts. You wait for Ben to finish sobbing so you can continue your conversation.\n\nHe stops crying, but it's not because he's calmed down. His eyes widen as he looks at something behind you. Instinct guides you toward the rifle on the floor, but you're thrown to the side before you can even touch it.\n\nYour shoulder slams into the ground and goes numb. Looking up, you see Markie straddling Ben, a scalpel in her hand. She's giggling. You can only see the side of her face but you know that your friend is gone. Blood and grime are dripping off her body, and her skin is peeling.\n\nAs if to remove all trace of doubt the creature inside her speaks: ""Now now, teacher's pet, no one likes a tattletale.""\n\n""The hell?!""

"Retreat with Markie.","You both retreat. ""Neil,"" you hear Meat yell over the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" Neil says.\n\nYou run and run and run. You surge ahead of Markie and lose feeling in your legs, but somehow you keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you eventually stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Meat running by himself. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You've covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you see her fling one of those crab creatures across the ground.\n\n""Damn!"" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces. The two of you rush over to her. She's holding her arm.\n\n""It got me,"" she says; there's fear in her voice. She turns to Meat. ""Where's Ryan?""\n\n""Goddamn fucking thing ate him. It ATE him.""\n\nMeat's answer fills you with cold. Ryan is dead. No one that close to you has ever died before. Your vision becomes unfocused. A slap on the arm brings you back.\n\n""We've got company, Julia. I need you here and now,"" Meat says, nodding at the mouth of the cave where the crab creatures are gathering. There must be thousands of them. Luckily, behind you the Speedwell is landing.\n\nMeat fires several shots at the crabs, but they don't seem to be leaving the cave anyway.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship's elevator.

"""Everybody cool?""","""Good question. Doctor?"" Salvucci says, turning to Strauss. She's red in the face, clearly panicked.\n\n""I don't know,"" she says. ""There's no way to know we're infected until we start seeing symptoms.""\n\n""Which would be...""\n\n""I don't know, Travis. From our brief encounter with Markie's transformation, I would be inclined to say that we would drop to the floor and start babbling nonsense while our bodies decayed, but she was bitten. If there was an airbone virus when that blob exploded, our transformations could be much more subtle. There's no way to know until whatever happens, happens.""\n\n""A comforting thought,"" Neil says.\n\n""The best thing we can do right now is...just wait. Maybe some of us get some shut eye and then rotate the guard.""\n\n""What are the guards looking out for, exactly?""\n\nStrauss looks at Meat and takes a breath. ""Symptoms.

"End Ryan's pain.","You take careful aim and fire a single shot that pierces Ryan's visor and kills him instantly. The squad vital monitor shrieks at you as he flatlines.\n\nThe beast roars again and then you catch a glimpse of the monster's hideous, reptilian face as it darts out and closes its jaws around Ryan's head. Like fingers plucking a grape from a vine, the beast rips out your squadmate's head leaving a bloody stump. \n\nYou flee.\n\nLooking over your shoulder, you watch as what's left of Ryan is pulled out of sight.\n\nYou run and run and run.

Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but eventually you stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie. Behind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the ground. You run toward your squadmates. You've covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell descending.\n\nWhen you reach them, Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fires several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie's arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your empty pistol and bash the monster's dome inward. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived, as Meat puts three rounds into the soft underbelly.\n\n""Fucking fuck."" He kicks the crab.\n\nYou turn to Markie, who's holding her arm. \n\n1.[[""Your suit's ripped.""]]"

"Shoot it!","You fire several rounds as well, tearing off her other arm. Still, the body convulses. You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He's a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body's back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren't far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Meat is looking over the bloody hole in Neil's chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil's mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I'm so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man.

"""Let's get the fuck home, eh?""","""Yeah, let's.""\n\nThe two of you walk back through the hallway leading to the hanger and then to the cockpit. The bodies of your crew are still there.

Meat says, shoving his own pistol into Neil's hands.\n\n""Bro, I've never used one of these.""\n\n""Well, if it makes you feel better, it wouldn't help much anyway. Bitch is a bullet sponge.""\n\n""Oh good, you know for a minute there I thought I might actually have decent odds for survival.""\n\n""Quit bickering,"" Salvucci says sternly. ""We'll go for the vent in the central hallway. From there we can spread out and cover the whole ship.""\n\nYou all make your way to the central vent, located in the belly of the ship. Salvucci pushes a button on the wall; the vent shrieks open and down pops a ladder.\n\n""I'll go north. Travis, you're with me. Julia and Neil, you go south. We meet back here in twenty minutes. If you spot it, call for help.""\n\nYou watch as Meat and Salvucci ascend the ladder. You and Neil wait a minute and then go up. \n\nThe shaft is tight, but both of you manage to fit, with you at the front. You crawl slowly, pistol in hand.\n\n""You know,"" Neil says after you've been crawling for five minutes, ""I never thought I'd go out like this. I thought that it'd be from a heart attack...in a bathroom or something, nude on a tile floor, ass up in the air.""\n\n1.[[""Neil. Shut the fuck up.""]]\n2.[[""Oh do tell.""]]"
"""It wiggled a lot.""","""Helpful information,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Great. If it's not dead, we're fucked. All we got left is your pistol.

If it is, we'll improvise.""\n\n""Great, I wonder who'll die next time thanks to our masterful improvisation skills.""\n\nStrauss says nothing. \n\nA few minutes later you reach the cockpit door. Ben's body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n\n""Well, that's good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You notice that Strauss is deliberately looking away from Ben's smashed skull.\n\nThe three of you step into the cockpit. You slam the door behind you.\n\n""Here's the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you. You type in ""KONAMI.""\n\nThe screen changes to a selection of menus.\n\n""There's the autopilot,"" says Strauss. She touches the screen and selects NEW AUSTIN.""\n\n""We done?"" Meat asks.\n\n""Yeah, I think we're set.""\n\n""Good.""\n\nAll of you approach the door.\n\n""Now let's get out of here before that fucking thing corn—"" \n\nA tentacle sweeps through the door as soon as it opens and brushes all of you aside with a mighty swing.

Looking up you see the thing step into view: it's monstrous, with a muscular human abdomen. \n\nThe thing's face is distinctly unhuman with countless slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster's mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattlesnake.\n\n""No!"" you hear Strauss scream as one of the tentacles darts out and wraps itself around her neck. It lifts her into the air and pulls her toward its master. You turn to look at Meat who's paralyzed with fear, watching one of the tentacles dance above him.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1.

You surge ahead of Markie and lose feeling in your legs, but somehow you keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but eventually you stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Meat running by himself. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You've covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you see her fling one of those crab creatures across the ground.\n\n""Fuck!"" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces. The two of you rush over to her.

Your vision becomes unfocused. \n\nA slap on the arm brings you back.\n\n""We've got company, Julia. I need you here and now,"" Meat says, nodding at the mouth of the cave where the crab creatures are gathering. There must be thousands of them.

"""See you on Mars.""","You slide into your chamber and the hatch closes. You quickly fall into slumber. When you wake up, you're surounded by soldiers. One of them, a corporal, is saying something but his words are soundless. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, and Meat are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nJust as Meat said, men in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, and Salvucci meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in almost complete silence, only uttering the name of the lost from time to time.\n\nYou all take seperate cabs home. When you reach your house in the suburbs, you pass your mailbox but decide to check it later. It's only when you swipe your card against the door's reader and hear it unlock that you feel as though you are truly safe. Inside, you shut the door and hang up your coat.\n\nYou go into the living room and sit on the couch. You do nothing but stare at the wall for hours, in a trance of sorts. You rub you finger up and down one of the cushions of your couch. You are alive to do this, but you're not sure you're thankful for that.\n\nYou begin to see a therapist. You make progress--according to him, anyway. You never really shake the memories of your time aboard the Speedwell, but you're able to cope with them.\n\nThat's more than can be said for Captain Salvucci, who eats a bullet on the third anniversary of your return to Mars. You don't go to the funeral.\n\nYou and Meat stay in contact but the emails you send one another are largely going through the motions bullshit. You never send a word to one another that is true. Your failure to connect with him is indicative of your relationship with the rest of humankind. You never marry or even begin what you're comfortable calling a relationship with anyone. For the first ten years or so, this bothers you but you slowly grow comfortable with this new you.\n\nYou become a writer. Your sci-fi erotica, written under a pseudonym, sells well enough for you to live comfortably by yourself and away from everyone. You're mostly happy, but sometimes there's a thought that strikes at you like a whip: you are completely alone.\n\nThe End"
"""Sure, Ryan.""","""Seriously though, I wonder if we'll find anything down here. I still think it's erosion. I mean, sure, these tunnels are uh pretty deep, I guess, but erosion can do that, right?

He turns to you. ""Make sure you have your gun ready, okay? I don't want Neil to get eaten because we ran dry.""\n\nYou check your pistol to make sure it has a full clip and nod. You all sit silently and listen to Neil in the other room. ""Please help me,"" you hear him beg. ""I can't find you guys.""\n\nThis goes on for 20 whole minutes, Neil's acting growing steadily worse. ""I fucking hurt my leg,"" he whimpers.\n\n""A thespian, he is not,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Just let the boy work,"" Meat replies, though it's clear he's getting tired of this as well.\n\n""Oh fuck,"" Neil says.\n\n1.[[Answer Neil.]]\n"

"""Get a drink.""","""I hear that.""\n\nThe two of you travel by cab to the nearest bar and order your weight in whiskey shots.

"Begin","The homeworld is nothing like you thought it would be.

But what is an ending but the beginning of another journey, wrote...who wrote that? You wrack your brain for an answer. The answer is just outside the limits of your consciousness, floating.

Neil shrieks as the cab takes off.\n\nYour house, it turns out, looks the same as it did before you left on your mission. You take two steps into the living room and fall onto the couch. You grip it with your fingers and, face pressed into the cushions, laugh and laugh and laugh.\n\nYou are home. You are alive and you are home. The military sticks you with an analyst job. Though it's quite boring, there's no danger of getting your head chewed off, so ultimately you're fine with it.\n\nSome years pass. You meet a lovely woman named Michelle at work. She asks you out to dinner. You like each other well enough, so you begin to date. Your relationship is a comfortable one that, though emotionally satisfying, often leaves you yearning for excitement.\n\nYour life is quiet, peaceful. You still meet up with Salvucci, Neil, and Meat from time to time at the bar. They like Michelle.\n\nOne night, Meat takes you aside. ""They're nuking earth.""\n\n1. [[""Say what?""]]"
"""We've got to go!""","""Meet us at the center of the crater!"" Markie yells over the comm.\n\nYou look at Ryan's heart monitor; he's about to flatline.

"""I don't know, you fucking horndog.""","""Right. Sorry. Dumb question,"" he says sheepishly. ""Kind of awkward to put you in that position anyway. I was just—""\n\nA blur of blue darts across your light. You raise your pistol. \n\nRyan looks over his back and then at you.\n\n""What is it?""\n\n1.[[""I saw something.""]]\n2.[[""Get out of the way.""]]\n3.[[""MOVE!""]]\n"
"""Sure, why not?""","""Thanks,"" she says quietly. You get a cab and tell him to take you to the nearest bar. There, the two of you sit in silence for at least an hour, sipping your drinks. Finally, Strauss speaks.\n\n""I killed the captain. I let Ben die.""\n\n1.[[""Yeah. You did.""]]\n2.[[""You're alive, doctor. Isn't that what counts?""]]"
"""What are you going to do when we get back?""","She smiles sadly. ""I don't even care at this point. Maybe retire? I have enough money...I don't know. Just no more space for me.""\n\n""I hear that,"" Meat says as he and Salvucci enter the room. ""No more fucking space EVER.""\n\n""Command is going to decide that, I'm afraid,"" Salvucci says, stepping in front of his pod.\n\n""If command thinks they're getting my ass back on a boat like this, they can go fuck themselves.""\n\n""I'll pass along the message when we get back."" He turns to Strauss. ""Are you okay, doctor?""\n\n""Yes, I'll be fine. Just ready for this to all be over.""\n\n""Well, let's get on our way then.""\n\nYou get in your pod and lie down. ""Sweet dreams everyone,"" you hear Meat say right before your chamber shuts itself. You close eyes. The world gets even darker.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, Meat, and Strauss are transported to the military outpost in New Texas. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night. It's delicious.\n\nMen in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, Salvucci, and Strauss meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in merriment, celebrating your survival, though you allow yourselves to mournfully drink a round and say small eulogies for the dead: Ben, Markie, Neil, Ryan.\n\nWhen all of you are finished, you share a cab that drops you off at your respective addresses. You're the first. Your comrades tell you to call them soon just to check in. Inside your small house in the suburbs, you finally allow yourself a good cry. Not for the dead. Not for any reason at all, in particular, except that it's been inside you for so long, struggling to get out.\n\nA week passes. You're relocated to analyst position on the military base in New Austin. You hear that Strauss is working at a military hospital in New Memphis. You never talk to her, really, but Salvucci and Meat send you emails all the time. Both of them have been reassigned to on-base positions; Meat's an instructor, and Salvucci can't tell you what he does. You imagine it has something to do with what you found on earth.\n\nYears pass. You never marry or have children, but you're never alone. Girlfriends come and go, at a rate of about one every five years. You become attached to them all and break down in sobs when each one leaves. You never tell any of your lovers about your experience aboard the Speedwell.\n\nYou and Meat become close. You meet twice a week for lunch. On Wednesdays, you watch sitcoms; on fridays, there's salsa night downtown. You get a dog. \n\nThis is your existence and it proceeds one day after another.\n\nInevitably, you grow old. Salvucci dies first. You and Meat attend his funeral. You and Meat take bets on who's next; turns out it's you.\n\nYou pass away one night in your sleep, your dog curled up behind you with his snout against your back, the poor creature peacefully unaware of your endless slumber.\n\nThe End\n\n\n"
"Shoot the switch.","Meat fires. Strauss' head falls back and her limbs go limp. Markie turns to see all of you. She growls and drops Strauss.\n\nThat's when you fire a single shot at the control panel. Upon impact the door seperating the hanger from the rest of the ship comes down, seperating you from the hanger. Alarms shriek. You watch from the door's window as both Strauss' corpse and the creature are sucked out into space. The two forms drift away until they're dots, inseparable from distant stars.\n\nNone of you give a cheer or breathe a sigh of relief, however. There's a sense of shame that hangs over all of you, an awareness of your cowardice. You played it safe so that one of your crewmates could sacrafice herself.\n\nThe auto-close kicks in and the hanger door shuts itself. The alarms cease their cries.\n\n""We should go check Neil's console,"" Meat says.\n\nThe three of you silently make your way to the cockpit. Inside, you find the autopilot already engaged. The console is covered in blood; the pilot's corpse is behind it.\n\n""He knew he wasn't going to make it,"" Meat says bitterly. ""Setting the autopilot must have been the last thing he did. Another goddamn hero.""\n\n""Everyone who died here will be honored when we get home,"" Salvucci says. \n\n""Oh good, because medals were really what I was concerned about,"" Meat says. ""I'm gonna go check the rest of the ship make sure nothing will snack on us while we sleep.""\n\n""I'll go with you,"" Salvucci says. ""Julia, go make sure the cryopods are ready.""\n\n1. [[Ready the cryopods.]]\n\n"
"""What made them?""","""Well, if I had to make a guess, I'd say a giant-ass earth worm...you know what an earth worm is, right?""\n\n1.[[""A what?""]]\n2.[[""Yes. I know what a goddamn earthworm is.""]]\n"
"""Ryan's chum.""","""Meet us at the center of the crater!"" Markie yells over the comm.\n\nYou look at Ryan's heart monitor: he's about to flatline.\n \nThat's when you hear the roar from the black.\n\nYou have a single bullet left.\n\n1. [[End Ryan's pain.]]\n2. [[Shoot the monster.]]"
"""What's up with you and Meat anyway?""","""He's a fool. I'm not. End of story."" The rest of the journey is silent.\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit.\n\nYou knock on the door.\n\nNeil's muffled voice comes from beyond the door: ""Password?""\n\n""Open the fucking door, pilot!""\n\n1.[[""Let's just go.""]]\n2.[["" Doctor Strauss is right; stop dicking around, Neil.""]]\n3.[[""Take it easy on him.""]]"
"""Burn 'em.""","You follow Salvucci as he leaves the room. Before you step out you turn to Meat. \n\n1.[[""Don't get yourself killed.""]]\n2.[[""You sick bastard.""]]\n"
"""Let's say I believe you and that this isn't all some dying dream. What's to prevent me from making the same mistakes and ending up back here again?""","The young man turns to you. His face is young, boyish. He thinks for a second. Finally, he speaks. ""Nothing. There's no guarantee of anything. You just have to hope.""\n\n1. [[""This is bullshit. If you can send me back, why can't you just make it so we all get home safely?""]]\n2. [[""Gee thanks.""]]\n\n"
"Send someone to check on Neil.","""I'll go,"" Strauss says. ""Anything to get away from this moron.""\n\n""Be careful, sweetheart,"" says Meat. ""It'd be a shame for you to get your face bitten off.""\n\n""Here. Take this."" Salvucci hands her his pistol. She nearly drops it.\n\n""Thanks, captain.""\n\n""Be careful.""\n\nWithout another word, she disappears around the corner.\n\n1. [[Continue onward to the mess hall.]]"
"""What is it?""","""There are tunnels.""\n\nRyan turns. ""Come again?""\n\n""Tunnels. In the crater. The last reconnaissance team didn't say anything about tunnels in their report.""\n\n""How long ago was that?""\n\n""Seven years. Give or take a month.""\n\n""Erosion. Boom.""\n\n1.[[""Shut up, Ryan.""]]\n2.[[""Erosion...right.""]]\n"
"""I don't.""","""Me neither,"" he says, not meeting your eyes. That's all he says on the matter. The week passes. He leaves. His wife, Rhonda, calls you a month later to tell you he passed away in his sleep. You can't make the funeral because traveling would worsen your ailing health even more.\n\nYou wait. You spend days watching old movies. You try to make your way through a collection of Christine Love's works, but you keep losing your focus.\n\nDeath comes when you're sitting in your loveseat watching a news report on a bridge being built in a neighboring county. It is a quick, painful tremor that starts in your chest and spreads out.\n\nAnd then the dark sets in;you never expected slipping away to be this easy.\n\nThe End\n"
"""Burn her just to be sure.""","Meat nods. Twenty minutes later he's scavenged the supplies for another Molotov. \n\nBoth of you return to Strauss' body. You watch silently as it burns.\n\n""We shouldn't move the bodies,"" he says. ""Might make us sick or something. Be a fucking shame to die over a little infection at this point,"" he says, attempting to smile, but he can't manage it. The will to smile or laugh has gone out of both of you. \n\nWhat future awaits you both now?\n\nYou both return to your cryo tubes and pop them open. They hiss and spew cold air on you.\n\n""Two months,"" he says as he stares at the tube, which you realize now looks very much like a coffin. ""Here's hoping nothing eats us while we're sleeping.""\n\nHe gets in his. You follow suit.\n\n""See you soon, kid.""\n\nYou press the button on the interior of the door and it slowly closes on your tube. You hear the seal clamp. A mist falls over your face.\n\nYou slowly closes your eyes and hope you wake up.\n\n1. [[Go to sleep]]\n"
"Take a bullet to the brain.","You can't kill them. You thought you could, but you're not strong enough. \n\n""Julia, put down the gun...please,""  Salvucci says, hand reaching toward you as he approaches.\n\n""Where's Meat?"" Neil asks.\n\n1. [[""I'm so sorry.""]]\n\n\n"
"""Watch your tone, Strauss. Getting real tired of your shit.""","Strauss says nothing.  You can't help but notice Neil's grin.\n\n""When are they supposed to be back?""\n\n""An hour from when we left,"" Strauss says.\n\n""How long ago was that?""\n\n""I don't know. I'm a doctor, not a timekeeper.""\n\n""Sheesh. Well, okay, so what should we do to pass the time?""\n\n""Time's going to pass regardless of what we do with it.""\n\n""Right. So you're going to sulk over there in the corner. Fine.""\n\nHe turns to you. Zoe?""\n\n1.[[Play Rock, Paper, Scissors.]]\n2.[[Play Tic-Tac-Toe.]]\n3.[[Sulk in silence.]]"
