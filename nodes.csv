"Say nothing at all.","Markie sighs. The four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss. The area of impact stretches for miles.\n\n“I don’t even see a fucking twig, man,” Meat says.\n\n“It’s been over a hundred years since the impact. I think all you’re going find is dirt down there,” Markie replies.\n\n“Don’t forget the radiation,” Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n“That too.”\n\nMarkie peers down. “Zoom,” she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n“You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?” Ryan asks Meat. “I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y’ know? Girls go for that sort of thing.”\n\nMeat grunts. “Not my woman. She’s endowed, but it ain’t with brains. The humor would, uh, escape her.”\n\n“And the radiation,” Markie points out.\n\n“Stupid radiation. Ruining everything,""" Ryan says.\n\n"""Hmm. That’s interesting,” Markie says—it’s almost a whisper.\n\n1. [["""Well, out with it Mark. What is it?"""]]\n2.[[Let someone else ask.]]\n"
"Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.","Meat takes the walkie from you. """Doc,""" he says.\n\n“Please hurry,” she begs. “We’re in the cockpit.”\n\n“Hustle people,” Meat says, breaking out into a sprint. \n\nYou and Neil follow. \n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci’s leg and tearing away flesh and muscle.  Salvucci is against the cockpit’s door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is next to his body.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n“Conserve the ammo,” Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben’s neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate’s skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben’s youthful face glares at you.\n\nThe thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He’s closing in.\n\n“Well don’t just stand there—shoot him!”\n\nYou aim down the sight.\n\n1.\t[[Fire the gun.]]\n"
"Remain silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.","Above you you hear the roar of the Speedwell's thruster as the ship lands. The sound frightens the fungal crabs back into their home.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open.  Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\n\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n“Get her to sickbay.”\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. She's delirious now, stumbling. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n“What happened to Ryan?”\n\n“I dunno. I think the blood on Markie's suit isn't all hers, though."""\n\n“Damn it, Travis. What did you find down there?”\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n“Where’s she wounded?” Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she looks around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n“And I was young and we were running,” Markie rambles, “eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.”\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[“What’s she saying?”]]\n2.[[“What is that?”]]"
"""Someone dropped you on your head when you were an infant, didn't they?""","“It doesn’t work like that, Ryan. I’m reading at least seven tunnels, carved out exactly the same size.”\n\n“Meaning what?”\n\n“There might be something down there.”\n\n“Spooky,” Meat says, peering through the scope of his rifle at the expanse of the crater.\n\n1.[["""We should check it out."""]]\n2.[["""Yeah, no, fuck that."""]]\n3.

"""Lenore.""",""""I found out what the first symptom is. It's fear. I woke up and I could feel the disease incubating in my body.

Her footsteps (and screams) trail away.\n\nAfter three minutes, Salvucci says """She's had enough time. Let's go."""\n\nThe three of you run down the hall to sickbay. She's inside, screwing a hose into a black machine in the corner of the room. She looks up.

"Talk to Meat and Neil","You approach the table. Neil takes one of Meat’s checkers.\n\nThey look up at you.\n\n“Thought we’d see a lot of boring shit on this trip, didn’t expect to run into a fucking alien,” Meat says.\n\n“Is it an alien, though? I mean, maybe it’s just something that’s been in the Earth the entire time?”\n\n“Shut up, Neil. You know what I meant.”\n\n“Hey, I’m just saying that maybe we should be a little more careful about the terms we’re throwing around, y’know, for science?”\n\n“Just play the damn game. “ He turns to you. “How are you holding up, Julia?”\n\n1.[[“I’m good.”]]\n2.[[“Could be better.”]]\n"
"""Well, out with it Mark. What is it?""","“There are tunnels.”\n\nRyan turns. “Come again?”\n\n“Tunnels. In the crater. The last reconnaissance team didn’t say anything about tunnels in their report.”\n\n“How long ago was that?”\n\n“Seven years. Give or take a month.”\n\n“Erosion. Boom,""" Ryan says.\n\n1.[["""Someone dropped you on your head when you were an infant, didn't they?"""]]\n2.[["""Uh..."""]]\n"
"Pick up the walkie","You pick up the walkie. Meat takes it.  """Neil, are you okay?"""\n\n“She’s fucking here, guys. Oh Jesus, she reeks.”\n\n“Sit tight,” Meat says. He nods at you. Both of you creep to the door. Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with perspiration. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that’s not what’s making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n“Stay away from me,” Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n“Now,” Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn’t even have time to turn her head before machinegun fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You’re not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you.  Luckily, there’s not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n“Oh godfuckingshit,” Neil yells. “That was Markie.”\n\nStrauss emerges from the kitchen, a napkin over her mouth and nose. She takes one glance and then looks away.\n\n“So, we like win now, right? They’re all dead?”\n\n“Yeah, I think—”\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie’s hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump. He fires the rest of the clip into the corpse.\n\n1. [[Shoot.]]\n2. [[Run.]]\n\n"
"""Let's go see Neil.""","Salvucci nods. “That’s a good idea.  You take doctor Strauss and do that. Travis and I will go check engineering. If it's wounded and looking for some place to hide, there’s plenty of spots. Let’s meet back here in an hour.”\n\nStrauss scoffs. “You’re treating the beast like it's a wounded animal limping toward its doom. You’re wrong. It showed no hesitation when it attacked. It’s not afraid of us. It’s waiting.”\n\nSalvucci wrinkles his nose as he is wont to do when someone says something that annoys him. “Regardless, we’ll find the creature and put it down.”\n\n“Creatures,” she says, correcting him. “There might be two of them now.”\n\n“Noted,” Meat says, replacing the clip in his rifle. You realize now that he has the most powerful firearm on the ship.\n“If you two run into it or them or whatever, don’t try to fight. Just run. Come find us.”\n\n“We should stop talking and get on our way,” Strauss says gruffly. “Before it eats that damnable pilot, which wouldn’t be such a bad thing if we didn’t need him to fly the ship.”\n\n“Now’s not the time for jokes, Doctor,” Salvucci says.\n\n“Who says I was joking?” Strauss replies before leaving the room. You follow.\n\n“Zoe,” Meat calls right before you step into the hallway. You turn. “Be careful.”\n\n1.[["""Don't worry about me, ya big softie."""]]\n2.[["""Whatever."""]]"
"“What else are we going to do?”","“All right, let’s get down to the hanger. Just…do me a favor. If we’re about to get sucked into space, just fucking shoot me, okay?”\n\n1.\t[[“Will do, partner.”]]\n2.\t[[“Happy thoughts, Meat. Happy thoughts.”]]\n"
"Finish programming the pods.","Strauss shows up just as you finish. She smells like smoke.\n\n"""It's done."""\n\nShe takes off her glasses and places them on a table nearby.\n\nShe looks at you, tears in her eyes, and says """I just want to sleep."""\n\nShe gets into her pod without another word. The hatch closes over her. You get in yours and close your eyes as the hatch seals. Sleep follows.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod. \n\nBoth you and Strauss are transported to private rooms on the biggest military outpost in New Austin. You order steak and wine but find that you don't have an appetite. Some suits interview you and, after you answer every question, you're told that you'll be allowed to leave soon.\n\n"""Soon""" turns out to be three days. You and Strauss meet on the base. She seems paler and thinner.\n\n"""Can we get a drink?""" she asks. """I just want to go somewhere, anywhere but home first."""\n\n1.[["""Sure, why not?"""]]\n2. [[Go on home.]]"
"""I'm alive.""",""""A keen observerer, you are.""" His voice is twangy. Maybe you're on Mars somehow.\n\n"""No,""" he says. """You're not on Mars. You fell into a rift and got yourself stuck between universes. To tell you the truth, I'm more impressed by your survival instinct than anything else. I thought I had patched all the holes."""\n\n1. [["""Holes?"""]]"
"We need to draw it out.","“Okay, with what?” Neil asks.\n\nThere’s a moment of silence as you, Meat, and Strauss turn to look at Neil. \n\n“Oh,” he says, getting it. “Well fuck that.”\n\n1. [[“Don’t be a baby.”]]\n2. [[“We could just knock you out.”]]\n\n\n"
"""Are you two serious? This is insane!""","“I already took one risk today, Zoe, and that got someone else killed. Superstitious or not, we’re doing this. Now come on.”\n\nSalvucci leaves the room. You turn to look at Meat.\n\n1.[["""Don't get yourself killed."""]]\n2.[["""You sick bastard."""]]\n"
"""Home. Let's get the fuck home.""","“Yeah, let’s.”\n\nThe two of you walk back through the hallway leading to the hanger and then to the cockpit. The bodies of your crew are still there, including the headless corpse of Dr.Strauss.\n\n“I was hoping she got away,” he said sadly.\n\n1.[["""Ditto."""]]\n2.[["""What happened, happened."""]]"
"""That's better. Now, any idea on how we kill this thing?""",""""One, but we have to act quickly. Let's go to sickbay."""\n\nYou follow her. When you get there, she tells you to lock both doors into the unit. You do so.\n\n"""How many rounds do you have left?""" she asks as she pulls out a small brush and a flask of a yellow sticky substance."""\n\nYou hand her the clip.\n\n"""Okay, good, there's enough here."""\n\nYou watch her get to work. She ejects each bullet from the clip and then sticks her brush carefully inside the flask. Pulling the brush from the flask, she coats each bullet with some of the goo.\n\n1.[["""Explanation please."""]]"
"""So if we can't melt it...what's the point?""",""""I'm getting there. The viewport windows are bulletproof, but enough acid might penetrate all the layers. All it takes is one crack on the outside layer."""\n\n1. [["""We're gonna blow him into space?"""]]"

"“She wants us to run out of resources.”","“She’s doing a hell of a job of it, then. Played us like a fuckin’ fiddl—”\n\n“Julia! Neil! Anyone!” Your walkie comes to life; it’s Strauss, her voice filled with panic.\n\nYou pull the walkie off your belt loop.\n\n“Please help us!” Strauss cries. “The captain keeps shooting but it’s not doin—oh god.”\n\nNeil looks at you in horror. You click the button on side the side of the talkie. You say:\n\n1.\t[[“Hold on, Doc. We’re coming!”]]\n2.\t[[“Serves you right.”]]\n3.\t[[Say nothing; give the walkie to Meat.]]\n\n"
"Blast 'em.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n"""Come on!""" Meat roars. """This isn't a fight we can win."""\n\nYou both retreat. """Neil,""" he yells into the comm. """Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here."""\n\n"""Coming as fast I can,""" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feelings in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You’ve covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n"""Markie,""" Meat says, """where's Ryan?"""\n\nShe stutters. """D...d..dead."""\n\n"""Fuck!""" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie. Her arm is wounded.\n\n1.\t[["""You alright?"""]]\n2.\t[[Stay silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.]]\n"
"“You better watch your tone, Doc. I’m getting tired of your bullshit.”","Strauss says nothing.  You can’t help but notice Neil’s grin.\n\n“When are they supposed to be back?”\n\n“An hour from when we left,” Strauss says.\n\n“How long ago was that?”\n\n“I don’t know. I’m a doctor, not a timekeeper."""\n\n“Sheesh. Well, okay, so what should we do to pass the time?”\n\n“Time’s going to pass regardless of what we do with it.”\n\n“Right. So you’re going to sulk over there in the corner. Fine.”\nHe turns to you. “Julia?”\n\n1.\t[[Rock, Paper, Scissors]]\n2.\t[[Tic-Tac-Toe]]\n3.\t[[Also sulk in silence]]"
"Shoot Ben.","You go for your gun, but someone beats you to the trigger. A shot tears off Ben's lower jaw, sending it flying into the wall. The second splits his forehead. The body falls back onto the floor and continues to gurgle.\n\nYou turn to see Strauss holding up the captain's pistol, tears in her eyes.\n\n"""Doc,""" Meat says, but she walks past him and continues to fire round after round into the corpse. Ben goes silent and still.\n\n"""Lenore,""" Salvucci says, reaching out to comfort her. \n\n"""We have to burn him too,""" she says, no hint of emotion in her voice. """Don't touch him.

"""If it's airborne, we're dead anyway."""\n\n"""I'll go get some oil then,""" say Meat.\n\n"""And I'll check on the console in the cockpit and hope to god Neil had enough time or selflessness to set up our autopilot.

"“I know.

Let’s get to the cockpit and decide what to do there.”\n\nYou make your way toward the cockpit. About halfway there, Meat speaks.\n\n“What was it doing when it killed Neil?”\n\n“Evolving,” Strauss answers.\n\n“Did you get a good look at it?” Meat asks.\n\n1.[["""I didn't."""]]\n2.[[“It had a lot of tentacles.”]]\n"
"Talk to Salvucci and Strauss","Salvucci is talking when you head over. You can see that Strauss is smiling, but it’s a sad smile.\n\n“She was a strong individual,” Salvucci says. “I’ve had her on four voyages. One time, three years back, we were all on Europa at the hanger and everyone was boarding, and this guy sets off the detector. He opens his shirt and reveals enough explosives to decimate every person in the hanger. Meat, Me, couple of others have got our guns trained on him, but Markie-–she talked him down. She saw what nobody else saw:just a stupid kid gripped in the thrall of some fundamentalist nonsense. She saved at least one life that day, probably more.”\n\n“She was a good soldier,” Strauss says sadly.\n\n1.[["""She was."""]]\n2.[[“That’s funny coming from the person who was more than ready to put her down a couple of hours ago.”]]\n"
"Shoot Neil too.","You shoot Neil as well. His corpse falls to the floor. His lifeless eyes look up at you in confusion.\n\nWhat now?\n\n1. [[Wait it out.]]\n2. [[Kill yourself.]]\n"
"""You crazy bitch.""",""""I had to kill him, you understand?""" she says. """He attacked me."""\n\n"""That's fine, doctor. He wasn't Ben anymore,""" Salvucci says.\n\n"""Relax, doc,""" Meat adds, rifle aimed at her chest.\n\n"""He bit me,""" she says, holding up her arm to show the bite mark. """Shit, he bit me."""\n\nMeat narrows his eyes and holds the rifle steadily. No one says anything. Tears stream down Strauss' face.\n\n"""Maybe if I had more time I could...but I can feel it in me now, coursing through my body. There's blood in the back of my throat. Vision blurry. Minutes. That's how long this takes to change us."""\n\nShe looks at the pistol, turns it over in her hand as though she's seeing something she's never seen before.\n\n"""Kill it,""" she says. """Don't let it reach Mars."""\n\nBefore any of you can stop her, she's pressed the barrel under her chin and pulled the trigger. Red splashes the ceiling. Strauss falls foward, head smashing into the floor.\n\n"""Fuck,""" Meat yells.\n\nWhatever color was left in Salvucci's face drains. Meat, in a moment of calculated rage, lifts his foot high over Ben's skull and stomps it several times. The insides of the boy's head ooze out like the innards of an old tomato. After he's done with Ben, he steps over to Strauss' body and aims his rifle down at her head.\n\nHe looks at the captain, who nods. He fires four shots and obliterates the top half of the woman's face.\n\n"""Shit shit shit,""" he groans, stepping away from the mutilated corpse.\n\n1.[["""We should check on the pilot."""]]"
"""Do I look like a fucking scientist, cap?""","“What killed Ryan?” Neil continues.\n\n“Stop talking, Neil,” Salvucci says with a raised voice before turning back to you. “Maybe Strauss was right.”\n\n“Captain, I have to insist. Ryan is a childhood buddy. I know his family. Somebody tell me what’s going on.”\n\n“Ryan got killed by some fucking thing,” Meat says. “Markie got bit by these crab things and she’s infected with something. Up to speed, dipshit?

"“What do we do?""",""""Should we look for it?""" Neil says.\n\n“Fuck that!” Meat says, turning. He aims his assault rifle at the first speaker and dismembers it with a single shot. He takes the second, third speakers out of commission as well. The music is no longer overpowering, but you can hear its echoes in the hallway.\n\n“Brutal but effective,” Strauss comments.\n\nSalvucci frowns. “You’re footing the bill for that when we get back.”\n\nNeil raises his finger. “Guys, now that Julia is awake, I think we should talk strategy. I just finished with our travel projections,""" Neil says.\n\n“And?” Strauss says, as though she knows what’s coming next.\n\n“Well, it’s like you said, doc: not good. Two months to Mars."""\n\n“We could last that long,” Salvucci says. “We ration food, ammo, go in groups to the rest of the ship when we need supplies.”\n\n“Captain, permission to speak?” Meat says.\n\nSalvucci nods.\n\n“That’s a horrible idea. We’ve got guns. Why don’t we use them? For all we know, that beastie thing could be growing. We need to hunt it down and kill it now.”\n\n“Travis, I put a gun against Markie’s head and blew her brains all over the floor. Apparently the thing inside her shook it off and walked away. I don’t think bullets are going to save us.”\n\n“Then we destroy the body completely,” Meat suggests. “Shoot it, stomp it, burn it, and then jettison the motherfucker into space.”\n\n“Captain, I don’t like either choice, but I think the more cautious one would be eliminating its presence from the ship,” Strauss says slowly.\n\n“Didn’t you say something about it being airborne?” Salvucci asks. “Could killing it infect one of us?”\n\nStrauss sighs, shrugs. “There’s no way to be sure. I didn’t get to run any tests on it. However, I’d rather take a chance on that possibility than risk us starving ourselves into easy prey.”\n\nSilence fills the common room. Then—\n\n“What do you think, Julia?” Neil asks.\n\nEveryone turns to you.\n\n1.\t[[“Let’s kill it.”]]\n2.\t[[“Let’s wait it out.”]]"
"Continue onward to the mess hall.","You proceed into the mess hall.\n\n"""Check everything,""" Salvucci orders.

" Pull out your pistol and fire blindly.","Meat fires the rifle across the room, the gun’s light chasing Markie’s feet as she darts away. You raise your pistol and fire blindly in front of Meat’s light, hoping to hit her with a lucky shot. Beside you, Neil screams in terror.\n\nYou hear the tell-tell click of the rifle as the clip goes dry. Meat swings the rifle around to point the flashlight at the door.\n\n“Go!”\n\nYou all make a beeline for the door. Meat yanks on the handle and light bleeds into the darkness, as all three of you sprint into the hallway. You slam the door and then bend over to catch your breath. Luckily, you manage to pull back just in time to avoid the spew of vomit that erupts from Neil’s mouth.\n\n“That was Markie—our Markie?” he says, wiping the spittle from his lip.\n\n“Yeah, it was,” Meat answers, a tinge of sadness in his voice.

Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters of Earth—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n“Run into any trouble?” Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n“Didn’t see a damn thing,” Meat says.\n\n“I’m telling you,” Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, “we won’t see it until it wants us to see it.”\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n“How’s your arm, doctor?” Salvucci asks.\n\n“Fine, captain.

You grip the railing beside you.\n\n“Hold on!”\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they’re pulled as well. Seconds later they snap off and go flying into the black.  \n\nMeat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster’s fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n“Eat shit and die, you fuck!” Meat screams through the comm. You can’t help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n“We did it,” Meat says. “We fucking did it.”\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly.

You can smell her from here, but that’s not what’s making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n“Stay away from me,” Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n“Now,” Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn’t even have time to turn her head before rifle fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You’re not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you.

He falls back onto the console.\n\nGood child, the voice says. Now set a course for the human world.\n\nYou approach the console, pushing Neil's corpse out of the way. Neil was logged in, luckily. You play around with the settings until you find the autopilot and set a course for Mars.\n\nThe voice tells you it's proud of you and that great things await. It tells you to wait, so you do. Later on, your body seizes and you flop to the ground like a fish. You watch with a mixture of horror and fascination as your arm explodes, spraying blood, skin, and bone everywhere, to reveal a purple jagged claw.\n\nNow, the voice says, your work truly begins. You follow its instructions and penetrate the chest cavities of Meat, Neil, and Salvucci with your claw. An hour later they've all risen. Of course, they're not really the people you knew. They're walking cocoons, dead flesh nuturing future soldiers.\n\nIt strikes you as odd that you should feel no guilt, but you chalk it up to how quickly you're evolving. Maybe guilt was, after all, a weakness that needed to be culled. The closer you get to Mars, the more changes your body undergoes. \n\nFirst, another claw sprouts. Next, in your sleep, you lose your skin and find it replaced with a hard shell-like body. You teeth fall from your mouth and are replaced with the kind of teeth monsters in fairy tales have.\n\nWhen you're a day away from the red planet, your soldiers hatch. They look like smaller versions of you.\n\nThey are to obey your every command, the voice says. Do not disappoint us, child.\n \nSoon you have forgotten your human life and have not only come to terms with what you are, but you look forward to your duties. The descendents of your new species will sing songs of your exploits and worship the very ground you have tread.\n\nMars looms and with it, your future.\n\nThe End\n\n"

He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n“Get her to sickbay.”\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship.

You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n“And I was young and we were running,” Markie rambles, “eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.”\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[["""What the hell is she saying?"""]]\n"

It flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\n“Let’s do this,” he says, pulling out his pistol.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head-Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. You see that yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\n“Ten bucks we find caveman drawings.”\n\n1.[[“Deal.”]]\n"
"""Maybe, maybe not. Either way, we don't have much to work with and we're running out of time.""","“All right, let’s get down to the hanger. Just…do me a favor. If we’re about to get sucked into space, just fucking shoot me, okay?”\n\n1.[["""More than happy to oblige."""]]\n2.[["""How about we plan on not dying?"""]]"
"“You’re talking about a jackalope, Meat, jeez.”",""""Huh, no shit?"""\n\nThe four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss. The area of impact stretches for miles.\n\n“I don’t even see a fucking twig, man,” Meat says.\n\n“It’s been over a hundred years since the impact. I think all you’re going find is dirt down there,” Markie replies.\n\n“Don’t forget the radiation,” Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n“That too.”\n\nMarkie peers down. “Zoom,” she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n“You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?” Ryan teases Meat. “I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y’know? Girls go for that sort of thing.”\n\nMeat grunts. “Not my woman. She’s endowed, but it ain’t with brains. The humor would, uh, escape her.”\n\n“And the radiation,” Markie points out, again.\n\n“Stupid radiation. Ruining everything,""" Ryan says.\n\nHmm. That’s interesting,” Markie says—it’s almost a whisper.\n\n1.[["""What is it?"""]]\n\n"
