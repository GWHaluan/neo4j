"""Not funny.""","He looks away; your remark stung.\n\n""Sorry,"" he says. ""She’s just getting on my nerves. I know she’s had it rough. She and Ben were a thing, so she’s on edge even more than usual, I guess.""\n\nThe two of you enter the cafeteria and then, after taking a precautionary look around, you go into the kitchen and stuff everything you can get your hands on into the two bags you brought from sickbay: fruit chips, soda, water bottles, pastries, canned soup.\n\nWhen you’ve filled the bags, you leave the cafeteria and make your way to the common room. Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n""Run into any trouble?"" Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n""Didn’t see a damn thing,"" Meat says.\n\n""I’m telling you,"" Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, ""we won’t see it until it wants us to see it.""\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n""How’s your arm, doctor?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n""Fine, captain. Thank you.""\n\nYou feel tired.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\n1. [[Talk to Meat and Neil]]\n2. [[Go to sleep.]]\n"
"Run. Like. Hell.","Meat fires the rifle across the room, the gun’s light chasing Markie’s feet as she darts away. You make a run for where you think the door is. Behind you, Neil screams in terror.\nYou hear the tell-tell click of the rifle as the clip goes dry. Meat swings the rifle around to point the flashlight at the door.\n\n""Go!""\n\nYou find the handle and yank on it. Light bleeds into the darkness as you all sprint into the hallway. You slam the door and then bend over to catch your breath. Luckily, you manage to pull back just in time to avoid the spew of vomit that erupts from Neil’s mouth.\n\n""That was Markie—our Markie?"" he says, wiping the spittle from his lip.\n\n""Yeah, it was,"" Meat answers, a tinge of sadness in his voice. He reloads the clip. ""This is my last one.""\n\n""Why didn’t she attack us?""\n\n1.[[""She wants us to run out of ammo.""]]\n2.[[""She's jerking us around.""]]\n"
"""Damn right you will.""","He nods. ""Yeah. I mean, it’s probably running around the ship, growing stronger by the minute, y’know?""\n\nNo one answers him. \n\nHe takes a breath. ""Okay, well, how are we going to do this?""\n\n""We’ll go to the cafeteria—big, open space,"" says Meat.\n\nYou all make your way to the cafeteria, eyes watching the walls and vents. The journey is a safe one. \n\nAll of you step into the mess hall.\n\nNeil looks out across the tables like a man looking at his own grave.\n\n""I always thought lunchrooms were kind of scary when I was a kids, ‘cause of the bullies and all. Never thought I’d die in one, though.""\n\n""You’ll be fine,"" Meat says. ""We’ll be in the other room. You’re gonna stay in here and use your walkie.""\n\n""To do what?""\n\n""Beg for help,"" Strauss says. ""Cry. Be bait.""\n\n""How’s it gonna hear that?""\n\n""Marki—what used to be Markie has a walkie clipped to her belt,"" Meat says.\n\n""And if she thinks it’s a trap?""\n\n""Then we come up with another plan. It’s animalistic though. I doubt it’ll pass up a wounded animal,"" Strauss answers.\n\n""Gee thanks.""\n\nYou, Meat, and Strauss step into the kitchen and move away from the door. He turns to you. ""Make sure you have your gun ready, okay? I don’t want Neil to get eaten because we ran dry.""\n\nYou check your pistol to make sure it has a full clip and nod. You all sit silently and listen to Neil in the other room. ""Please help me,"" you hear him beg. ""I can’t find you guys.""\n\nThis goes on for 20 whole minutes, Neil’s acting growing steadily worse. ""I fucking hurt my leg,"" he whimpers.\n\n""A thespian, he is not,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Just let the boy work,"" Meat replies, though it’s clear he’s getting tired of this as well.\n\n""Oh fuck,"" Neil says.\n\n1. [[Answer Neil.]]\n"
"Remain quiet.","""There are tunnels.""\n\nRyan turns. ""Come again?""\n\n""Tunnels. In the crater. The last reconnaissance team didn’t say anything about tunnels in their report.""\n\n""How long ago was that?""\n\n""Seven years. Give or take a month.""\n\n""Erosion. Boom.""\n\n1.[[""Shut up, Ryan.""]]\n2.[[""Erosion...right.""]]\n"
"""Get your head in the fucking game.""","""Yeah,"" he says, not meeting your eyes. ""Okay.""\n\n""He gave you a password, right?"" Strauss says. ""Maybe there’s an autopilot sequence on his computer.""\n\n""Doesn’t do us any good if that thing is still stomping around.""\n\n""Do you really think it survived that blast?""\n\n""Is that a serious question?""\n\n""Either way, we need to get the ship moving. Let’s get to the cockpit and decide what to do there.""\n\nYou make your way toward the cockpit. About halfway there, Meat speaks.\n\n""What was it doing when it killed Neil?""\n\n""Evolving,"" Strauss answers.\n\n""Did you get a good look at it?"" Meat asks.\n\n1.[[""It wiggled a lot.""]]\n2.[[""I did not. I was too busy running for my life.""]]\n"
"Go to sleep.","You walk over to the bar and take a lie down. It feels like it’s been years since you’ve slept, but you’re afraid to go to sleep, uncertain of whether you’ll relive the horrific deaths of your crewmates in your dreams. Terror is not enough to keep you from closing your eyes, though. You’ll need your strength if you’re to survive the rest of the voyage.\n\nSleep comes easier than you expected. There are no dreams. At least, you don’t see anything. However, there are sounds. Clapping, to be precise.\n\nThe common room abruptly comes into view as Meat shakes you awake. The sound of clapping is engulfing the room. Getting to your feet, you see Strauss has her ears covered. A guitar now. Music playing.\n\n""Tequila!"" the ceiling speakers shout. \n\nYou turn to Meat.\n\n1.[[""What’s going on?""]]\n"
"""What's waiting for you on Mars?""","""What kind of question is that? Here and now? You’ve never made the effort bef—oh, I see. You’re just trying to make conversation. Well, fine then: I have nothing waiting for me. How does that sound? Nothing. Not a lover, not a child, not even a pet. This was my life and now it’s gone to shit.  Well now I feel good about myself. How about you?  Any boys waiting for you?""\n\n1.\t[[""No.""]]\n2.\t[[""A woman, actually.""]]\n\n"
"""Strauss is taking her freakin' arm off.""","Meat makes a face. ""Fucking Nazi. It’s a tiny bite. Can’t they just disinfect it? It was bad enough losing somebody; we don’t have to maim her.""\n\n1.[[""It's straight up bullshit.""]]"
"""We need to draw it out into the open.""","""Okay, with what bait?"" Neil asks.\n\nYou and Meat look at Neil.\n\n""Oh,"" he says, getting it. ""Well fuck that.""\n\n1.[[""Don't be a pussy.""]]\n\n\n"
"""Don't talk like that, cap.""","You open your mouth to speak, but you're cut off by a familiar voice. ""Well, captain, I guess it’s too much to hope for some confidence in my abilities.""\n\nOut from a supply closet steps Strauss. Sweat is dripping off her face and there’s blood on her lab coat.\n\n""Doctor, are you hurt?""\n\n""No,"" she says. ""It broke through the glass and grabbed me, but Ben pushed it off. I ran and didn’t look back. I heard him scream behind me.""\n\nSalvucci looks at you nervously.\n\n1.[[""Your boyfriend's toast.""]]\n"
"""Hot dogs, dude. Hot dogs.""","""Oh yes! I've forgot about hot dogs. Man, I want chili and cheese and--""\n\nYou hear a sound.\n\nMeat whips out his rifle and aims it down the line.\n\n""What the fuck was that?""\n\n1. [[""Just a rock or something.""]]\n2. [[Unholster your weapon.]]"
"""It’s covering any sound it could be making.""","""Well, we’re about to put an end to that shit,"" Meat says as you approach the crew’s quarters. You see large cables running through the doorway; they lead up the wall and into the ceiling.\n\nNeil reaches up and runs his hand along the cables. He quickly pulls it back. ""Augh! Fuck!""\n\n""What is it?"" Meat barks.\n\n""Nothing,"" Neil says, regaining his composure. ""Just fucking slime. Oh god, gag a maggot,"" he says. ""This shit reeks."" He holds his hand up to the light to reveal a goopy, transparent liquid.\n\n""Hey, that looks a little bit like—""\n\n""Don’t you fucking say it, Travis.""\n\nYou examine the cables without touching them.\n\nMeat takes a look as well. ""Seems like a complicated operation.""\n\n""What, turning on the computer, starting a program, and plugging in some cables?""\n\nMeat turns. ""You didn’t see how feral this thing was—not to mention she’s missing a goddamn arm.""\n\n1.[[""It might be Ben.""]]\n"
"""Calm your tits, everybody.""","""Believe me, Zoe, I’m all for a long, relaxed, and rational conversation, but we can’t afford that luxury. She could expire and change at any moment.""\n\n""This is a bad horror movie,"" Ben moans, staring into the glass while Markie gazes at her own cauterized stump. She’s drooling now and has a nosebleed. You can see black veins popping beneath the skin on her forehead. It is like a bad horror movie.\n\n""Enough,"" Salvucci says at last. ""We’re not killing anyone on my ship—we’re not savages.""\n\nMeat is relieved. ""Thanks boss.""\n\n""This is a mistake,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Maybe,"" he says, ""but it’s my mistake to make, not yours. Do what you can to keep her alive and prep her for cryo sleep.""\n\n""Again, a mistake.""\n\n""Doctor Strauss, unless you want to be brought before a military tribunal for insubordination, I suggest you do as I say.\n\n""Yes, captain,"" she says, voice calm, but there’s a fire in her eyes. ""Ben, lower the temperature to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We’ll try to freeze her.""\n\nMarkie looks up at you all. A smile breaks out over her face and then she leans over and pukes.\n\n""Disgusting creature,"" Strauss mutters.\n\n""Travis, Zoe, to the cockpit,"" Salvucci says.\n\n1.[[Head to the cockpit.]]"
"""Space food's not so bad.""","""Easy for you to say, Miss I-snuck-my-favorite-snack-onboard.""\nHe's talking about your soy oatmeal cookies.\n\n""I don't blame you though. Wish I had been clever enough to get some chip--""\n\nYou hear a sound.\n\nMeat whips out his rifle and aims it down the line.\n\n""What the fuck was that?""\n\n1.[[""Probably just a rock falling.""]]\n2.[[Take out your weapon]]"
"""Don't get yourself killed, asshole.""","""You too, princess.""\n\nHe gets in position. A second later, the door bursts open and flies across the hanger. In steps the monster, mouth stained with blood, eyes looking about wildly.\n\nIt takes a step toward you.\n\n""Over here, motherfucker!"" Meat shouts through his suit’s comm.\n\nIt growls and moves toward him. Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall. He grabs onto a wall-railing.\n\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n""Do it, do it now.""\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he’s behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n""Hold on!""\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they’re pulled as well. A moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster’s fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm. You can’t help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n""We did it,"" Meat says. ""We fucking did it.""\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly. You both laugh.\n\n""We’re alive!""\n\n1.[[""Let's get the fuck home, eh?""]]"
"""Step off, cunt.""","Strauss says nothing.  You can’t help but notice Neil’s grin.\n\n""When are they supposed to be back?""\n\n""An hour from when we left,"" Strauss says.\n\n""How long ago was that?""\n\n""I don’t know. I’m not your timekeeper.""\n\n""Sheesh. Well, okay, so what should we do to pass the time?""\n\n""Time’s going to pass regardless of what we do with it.""\n\n""Right. So you’re going to sulk over there in the corner. Fine.""\n\nHe turns to you. ""Zoe?""\n\n1.[[Play Rock, Paper, Scissors.]]\n2.[[Play Tic-Tac-Toe.]]\n3.[[Sulk in silence.]]"
"""Neil, stop talking.""","""Hey, fuck you. I’ve been cooped up in that room this whole time. Forgive me for being a little curious about why everything around me is going to hell.""\n\nThe three of you say nothing for the rest of the walk, but you can’t shake the feeling that Neil is angry at you.\n\nWhen you reach the sickbay, it’s deserted.\n\n""I suppose they're still out looking for it—or they’re dead.""\n\n""Jesus,"" Neil says, approaching the puddle of gore in the center of the room. He stands there, gazing down at it. \n\nYou lean against the wall and take a seat, but your pistol remains in your hand. \n\n""Meat and the captain aren’t really dead, are they?""\n\n1.[[""No, they're tough fuckers.""]]\n2.[[""Yeah, they're chum.""]]\n"
"""Fuck. You.""","He and Meat laugh. You see a smile creep onto Salvucci's face.\n\n""Thanks, Julia"" he says. ""You're the reason we're alive. You can expect great things when we get back.""\n\nBoth Meat and Neil help you into your pod. \n\n""Don't worry, you won't be the only human popsicle. We're just going to make sure the ship's clean before we all go to sleep. Rest easy.""\n\n1.[[""Yeah, yeah, get on with it.""]]\n2.[[""When I wake up, I expect to have kickass robo-limbs.""]]\n"
"""What, no foam finger for me?""","""Ah, she's funny, Meat! I forgot how funny she was!"" he yells. Meat, grinning, shushes him.\n\n""Oh, am I too loud?""\n\nSalvucci soon arrives. Everyone, including you, buys each other rounds until you're all bloated and sick and green.\n\nOutside, you vomit in the street while you wait for a cab.\n\n""I'll...I'll get my car later,"" Meat says.\n\nSomehow you all manage to tell the cabbie your respective addresses. You stumble out of the cab at your house and tell the others you'll call them later.\n\n""Bionic woman!"" Neil shrieks as the cab takes off.\n\nYour house, it turns out, looks the same as it did before you left on your mission. You take two steps into the living room and fall onto the couch. You grip the cushions with your fingers and, face pressed into them, laugh.\n\nYou are home. You are alive and you are home. You wake up the next morning, mouth dry and head pounding. You take a shower and then call that doctor.\n\n""Jessica,"" she tells you. ""That's my name.""\n\nYou ask her out for coffee. You meet her at a coffee shop and both you order terrible tasting drinks. It's clear you both like each other. She invites you back to her place, a nice apartment with windows that face the belly of the Valles Marineris. You make love; it's nice.\n\nSoon you're dating. You agree to an open relationship but, within a month, you're dating exclusively.\n\nThe outpost in New Ausin has given you an analyst position. While you resent the military's decision that your disability keeps you from being combat ready, part of you is relieved to be away from danger (the raise is nice, too).\n\nYour life is quiet, peaceful. You still meet up with Salvucci, Neil, and Meat from time to time at the bar. They like Jessica, though Neil is a bit too flirty with you for Jessica's liking.\n\nOne night Meat takes you aside. ""They're nuking earth.""\n\n1.[[""They're doing what?""]]\n\n"
"Awaken.","Meat's there when you wake up. You're lying under a sheet on the examination table in sickbay and can't move.""\n\n""Goddamn, you're lucky Salvucci was a medic back in the day.""\n\n1.[[""Where's Markie?""]]"
"""She didn't.""","You both take a breath.\n\n""What happens now?""\n\n1.[[""We kill it.""]]\n2.[[""I've got at least two rounds left.""]]"
"Blast the little bastards.","You both retreat. ""Neil,"" Meat yells over the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" you hear the pilot say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You surge ahead of Markie and lose feeling in your legs, but somehow you keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you eventually stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way you see Meat running. Ryan is nowhere to be found. You’ve covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you watch her fling one of the crab creatures across the ground.\n\n""Fuck!"" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces. The two of you rush over to her. She's holding her arm.\n\n""It got me,"" she says; there's fear in her voice. She turns to Meat. ""Where's Ryan?""\n\n""Goddamn fucking thing ate him. It ATE him.""\n\nMeat's answer fills you with dread. No one that close to you has ever died before. Your vision becomes unfocused. A slap on the arm brings you back.\n\n""We've got company, Zoe. I need you here and now,"" Meat says, nodding at the mouth of the cave where the crab creatures are gathering. There must be thousands of them. Luckily, behind you, you hear the Speedwell land.\n\nMeat fires several shots at the crabs, but they don't seem to be leaving the cave anyway.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you, his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster. He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What the hell is she saying?""]]\n"
"""42.""","""While I appreciate your clever literary reference, that is not in fact the password.""\n\nStrauss slams the fist of her unwounded arm against the door.\n\n""Listen here, you little shit. You open this door right now or so help me I’ll put you to sleep, slather whatever honey we have left in the cafeteria on your testicles, and we’ll use you as bait.""\n\nThe door slides open. Neil’s face, boyish as ever, awaits you and Strauss. He is unharmed.\n\n""It eats honey?""\n\n""I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fathom the depths of your stupidity, pilot.""\n\nNeil frowns; he seems genuinely hurt by the remark.\n\n1.[[""Let’s just go.""]]\n2.[["" Doctor Strauss is right; stop dicking around, Neil.""]]\n3.[[""Take it easy on him.""]]\n"
"Go to the cockpit.","You and Meat follow the captain to cockpit. Neil, the ship’s pilot, sits at the controls. He smiles when the three of you enter--he has a thing for you.\n\n""Hello darling.""\n\n""Cut the shit, Neil,"" the captain barks.\n\n""Yes, captain,"" he says, deflated.\n\n""Meat take over the co-pilot controls for Markie.""\n \nMeat nods, takes a seat. Neil looks over at him. ""You’re a bit pale, big boy. Something happen?""\n\n""Shut the fuck up, Neil. Just do your job.""\n\n""Sheesh.""\n\nSalvucci turns to you. ""Okay, I need you to be straight with me: what are we dealing with? Do you think she’s going to turn into whatever killed Ryan?""\n\n""Woah, shit,"" Neil says, turning in his seat. ""Ryan’s dead? What happened?""\n\n""Leave it alone,"" Meat says.\n\n""Julia?"" Salvucci says.\n\n1.[[""Look, all I know is that whatever we found on Earth wasn't human.""]]\n2.[[""We’ve got guns;we can handle her if shit goes down.""]]\n"
"""Just a rock or something.""","The words aren't out of your mouth when you hear it again: scuttling, and then something else--a high pitched whine that sends a shiver down your spine.\n\n""We're not alone,"" Meat says, voice low.\n\n""What's that?"" you hear Ryan say over your comm.\n\n""There's something in here with us. We're turning back.""\n\nHe nods at you and you both slowly back away. You pull out your pistol.\n\n""What do you see, Meat?"" Markie asks.\n\n""Dunno. Sounds like a wolf. Don't like it whatever it is.""\nThe whine again. You focus your eyes and see something moving in the dark.\n\nMeat sees it, too. He fires at it. As muzzle fire fills the cave with flashes of light you see that the creature isn't one thing: but many things, with feelers and sharp teeth.\n\nThey rush toward you, hundreds of them.\n\n""Let's get out of here,"" Meat yells.\n\n1. [[Blast 'em.]]\n2. [[Get out of there.]]\n"
"""That was a bit harsh, Doc.""","She looks at you coldly.

You take one last look at Strauss and Salvucci before they disappear around the bend.

"Shoot the window.","You unload your clip into the window. On the fourth shot you hear a sucking sound. \n\nBingo.\n\nThe doctor leaps back behind the door. You smash the button and the emergency door comes down between you and the beast. It wastes no time in striking at the door with its tentacles. You watch through the glass in the door as the viewport's glass cracks, shatters, and is sucked into space. The beast, though it tries to cling to the inside of the ship with its appendages, is sucked out shortly after.\n\n""We did it,"" Strauss says, relieved. The alarms blare for a few minutes until the emergency panel comes down and covers where the viewport was.\n\nThe door in front of you lifts, giving you access to the rest of the ship again.\n\n""I guess we should burn the other bodies.

"""Not great.""","He sighs. ""Figured as much.""\n\nThe PA clicks on: ""All officers report to sickbay,"" Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his bowl and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you’re out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nYou and Meat exchange no words on the way to sickbay. The door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube.

Her footsteps (and screams) trail away.\n\nAfter three minutes Salvucci says ""She's had enough time. Let's go.""\n\nThe three of you run down the hall to sickbay. She's inside, screwing a hose onto a black machine of some sort. She looks up. ""I told you to give me mor--""\n\nShe's interrupted by Markie's descent from the ventilation shaft onto the examination table. She growls at all of you.

""Ocelot.""\n\nThe door slides open, and Neil's boyish face is there to greet you. ""Heard gunshots. You guys killin' things out here?""\n\nSalvucci cuts to the chase. ""Doctor Strauss, Ben, and Markie are dead. Whatever killed them is still on the ship, dressed in Markie's skin.""\n\nNeil looks at you all from left to right.

"Go to sleep","It’s as though no time passes between the moment the darkness falls over you to when you open your eyes again and see ten soldiers standing over you, peering down, each of them equipped with assault rifles.\n\n""Come on, lieutenant,"" one of them says, lifting you to your feet. You see Meat being held up by two soldiers. He’s grinning like a fool.\n\n""We did it,"" his eyes say.\n\nThe troops escort you both to your own personal rooms where you’re served cheap steak and soda pop. It all tastes superb.\n\nLater, you and Meat are interviewed about the incident aboard the Speedwell. Security footage corroborates your testimonies. \n\nYou stay in your room for a week, feeling shackled and hoping that the military doesn’t eliminate you because of secrets you shouldn’t know. You and Meat are then taken to meet a general and his staff. You tell them your story. The old man nods and thanks you for your bravery.\n\nAnother day goes by and then, finally, you are released by the staff into the world.

"Get drinks with Meat.","""I hear that!""\n\nThe two of you travel by cab to the nearest bar and order your weight in whiskey shots.

And then comes the silence where you both sit, staring at the table, saying nothing, just drinking as you come to grips with the fact that you’re both alive.\n\n""I should get home,"" Meat says. ""Rhonda’s waiting. Give me a call if you need anything, okay?""\n\n1.[[""You do as well.""]]"
"""Where on the ship did you look?""","""Everywhere,"" Meat says before swallowing a chip. ""Engineering, the cafeteria, the cryo room. We checked every nook and cranny.

Wait till we get sick and hungry enough for it to overpower us. Did you even bother thinking about the logistics of that move? Cryosleep is part of the ship’s travel. We don’t have enough food on board to support us until we reach earth. We have maybe a month at the most before we run out. Then what?""\n\n""I don’t know, okay?

The common room will be easier to forify and protect than this place. We can worry about long term plans once we get set up there.

There’s shattered glass on the floor—probably the lights."" He creeps into the room slowly. \n\nYou and Neil follow.\n\nRemember me to the one who lives there…\n \nThe room is pitch black except for the light coming from the computer terminal next to Neil’s bed. The computer, a custom built powerhouse, sits on the floor and is connected to an obnoxiously large, wall-mounted flat screen. On the screen, you see a music library. Meat flashes his light across the floor. There’s at least 11 or 12 footsteps separating you and the terminal, a no-man’s land of shattered glass and possible traps.\n\n""Well,"" Neil says after a moment. ""I guess one of us should cross—""\n\nGunfire cuts Neil’s sentence off as Meat fires three rounds into the terminal. The music dies abruptly.\n\n""Are you fucking kidding me?!""  Neil erupts. ""That was two months worth of pay! It was like, the ultimate fucking entertainment system, dude.""\n\nYou can’t make out Meat’s expression in the dark but you can tell he’s not in the mood to deal with Neil’s shit. ""Listen, if we get out of this alive, I’ll buy you a new toy, okay?""\n\n""It was brand new!""\n\n""Shut up. Did you hear that?""\n\nYou listen. You hear nothing, not the crackling of glass, or an insidious snicker. Nada.\n\n""Let’s go,"" says Meat. You all turn, and, of course, there she is, standing next to the door.\n\nNeil gasps in horror. Markie smiles at all of you, the hallway light shining on her face to reveal rotting flesh and a dangling eyeball. Her arm stump oozes yellow.\n\nMeat raises his rifle, but he’s too slow.

"Rush her.","You're on your feet when you see Markie twisting the knife in Ben’s skull; the boy convulses.\n\nYou dart across the room and tackle her. She topples over the upturned table. You're ready to charge again but Salvucci beats you to it. He places his pistol against Markie's temple. He fires. Brain, skull bits, and strands of hair blast across the light and onto the floor. The thing that was Markie convulses, blood spewing out of her nose and mouth as she giggles.\n\nThe red eyes roll around in her head like in a slot machine before settling on you.\n\n""Buy two hypostims, get three free. Just come on down to the Couponia at Rylock’s junction this Saturday—""\n\nSalvucci puts another bullet in its face. Markie jerks, and then stops moving completely.\n\nMeat examines Ben's corpse. ""He's dead."" The boy’s face is a sea of blood and torn flesh. Half his eyeball has been pushed up through the socket.\n\nA moment passes. Meat raises his gun and puts a round through Ben’s head. You leap back in surprise.\n\n1.[[""What the shit, Travis?""]]\n"
"""He said it was a bomb.""","""Oh no no no no,"" Strauss says. She sticks her fingers in her mouth.\n\n""What the hell are you doing, doctor?""\n\nShe retches and pulls her fingers out. ""What does it look like? We could be infected. Shit, we shouldn't even fucking be here right now. Get out!""\n\nShe gets up and makes a dash for the door. The rest of you follow her into the hallway. ""Showers,"" she yells.  She leads you to the shower stalls.\n\n""Shouldn't we be using the one in your lab?"" Meat asks, taking his shirt off.\n\n""Not enough fucking time,"" she says, ripping off her shirt and bra, not bothering to cover her breasts. ""Hurry!"" She rushes into one of the stalls.\n\nYou disrobe and disappear into a stall of your own. Hot water washes over you, cleansing you of the gunk on your body.\n\n""Wash your hair! Make sure every bit of you is clean!"" Strauss screams.\n\nYou shampoo and rinse your hair. You spend half an hour scrubbing yourself. When you step out, Meat thrusts a towel in your hands--his eyes closed--so you can cover yourself. You wrap yourself up and go to your locker to fetch your spare uniform. A couple of minutes later, you're dressed. You step back into the shower room to see Meat putting on his boots. Salvucci, Strauss, and Neil are there as well, wearing their uniforms.\n\n1.[[""Everyone okay?""]]\n2. [[Wait for someone to say something.]]\n"
"""We could just knock you out.""","""That's a joke, right? You're joking.""\n\nMeat slaps Neil on the shoulder. ""We won’t let you get eaten. You gotta do this. You’re the tiniest one—the easiest prey, see?""\n\n""You’re not making this any more appealing.""\n\n""We can’t make him do this,"" Strauss interjects, finally saying something.\n\n""When the fuck did you grow a conscience? ""Meat growls.\n\n""I did what I did for the sake of survival. There were no other options. There are other options here. We just need to think rationally.""\n\n""Well,"" Meat says.

"""You’re talking about a jackalope, Meat, jeez.""","""Huh, no shit?""\n\nThe four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss. The area of impact stretches for miles.\n\n""I don’t even see a fucking twig, man,"" Meat says.\n\n""It’s been over a hundred years since the impact. I think all you’re going find is dirt down there,"" Markie replies.\n\n""Don’t forget the radiation,"" Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n""That too.""\n\nMarkie peers down. ""Zoom,"" she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n""You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?"" Ryan teases Meat. ""I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y’know? Girls go for that sort of thing.""\n\nMeat grunts. ""Not my woman.

"Head to sickbay.","The lights are off in sickbay. As you step inside a rotten smell hits you in the face. It takes all your strength not to lean over and barf.\n\n""What the hell is that?"" Meat says.\n\n""Doctor Strauss? Ben?"" Salvucci calls.\n\nThe three of you inch forward. Meat turns on the flashlight attached to his rifle. There’s a giant blood smear on the wall.\n\nHe gently moves the rifle around, illuminating different areas in the room.\n\n""What do you think happened?"" Meat asks.\n\nBefore you can answer, you step on something. Something squishy. Meat casts his light on it.\n\n1. [[Peer down.]]"

The landscape is black as tar and the temperature readings make you thankful for the air conditioning in your suit.\n\nThe crater, the reason for your journey, is dead ahead, a half mile in the distance.

But what is an ending but the beginning of another journey, wrote…who wrote that? You wrack your brain for an answer. The answer is just outside the limits of your consciousness, floating.

"Set up the cryopods.","You head to the cryogenic room and prepare the four pods. Strauss is the first to make it in. She's pale.\n\n""Are they almost ready? Good. I am so ready to be asleep.""\n\n1.[[""What are you going to do when we get back?""]]\n"
"""Let’s wait it out.""","""Ugh. You too?"" Meat groans.\n\n""We're going to regret this,"" Strauss says.\n\nSalvucci shakes his head. ""We'll be fine. Strength in numbers. As long as we stick together, we won't lose anymore people.""\n\nThe four of you decide to stick it out in the mess hall. Meat, you, and Salvucci take turns keeping an eye on the door for Markie. Strauss rations the food that comes out of the pantry...including your soy cookies. You try not to hold it against her.\n\nA week passes. No sign of the creature yet.\n\n""Nice beard you've got going on there, Neil,"" Meat tells the pilot, who's been cultivating uneven patches of facial hair.\n\n""Bite me, big man.""\n\nYou're in the middle of biting into the last half of your final soy cookie when you hear the sound in the vent--something squishy.\n\n""You heard it too?"" Meat says, standing up and pointing his rifle at the vent.\n\nSomething starts to hammer at the vent cover.\n\n""It's her!"" Salvucci yells. ""Fire!""\n\nThe three of you unload your clips into the vent. The destroyed cover falls to the floor. And then something else: A giant, bulbous, leaky sack that explodes when it hits the ground. Blood and pus fly everywhere. \n\nYou black out.\n\nWhen you come to, Meat's helping you up. He, like you and everyone else, is covered in gore.\n\n""Everyone alright?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n""Yeah, ugh this is so nast--"" Meat is interrupted by Strauss leaning over and vomiting on the floor.\n\n""Couldn't have said it better myself, doc. What was that? A bomb?""\n\n""It's...oh god,"" Strauss spits. ""It's what left of her.""  She points at something on the ground.\n\n1. [[Look where she's pointing.]]\n"
"""Screaming isn't going to get us anywhere, Neil.""","""You're right. Let's, uh, let's go to the cockpit. Set a course for Mars.""\n\nYou follow Neil to the cockpit. Halfway there he stumbles and nearly falls. ""I'm okay!"" he says. ""I'm okay.""\n\nIn the cockpit, Neil nearly trips when he gets to the console, curses; he turns to you and his face pales.\n\n""You're bleeding...from your eyes.""\n\nYou feel the wetness on your cheek. You put a finger to the wetness and come away with a red smattering. You look at Neil and see that he's bleeding from his nose. After a second, he notices too.\n\n""I guess we're both infected now. Shit.""\n\n1. [[""Fuck. Guess the old man was right.""]]"
"Shoot her.","You shoot her in the face. Her corpse falls back onto the floor and is still.\n\nMoments later both Neil and Salvucci burst through the door. Salvucci's gun is in his hand.

"""You sick fuck.""","Meat turns away without a word. He leaves through the other sickbay door.\n\nYou step outside to find Salvucci unholstering his pistol.\n""Better to be safe than sorry.

"""So, doc, what are you going to do when we get back?""","She smiles sadly. ""I don't even care at this point. Maybe retire? I have enough money.I don't know. Just no more space for me.""\n\n""I hear that,"" Meat says as he and Salvucci enter the room. ""No more fucking space EVER.""\n\n""Command is going to decide that, I'm afraid,"" Salvucci says, stepping in front of his pod.\n\n""If command thinks they're getting my ass back on a boat like this, they can go fuck themselves. Violently.""\n\n""I'll pass along the message when we get back."" He turns to Strauss. ""Are you okay, doctor?""\n\n""Yes, I'll be fine. Just ready for this to all be over.""\n\n""Well, let's get on our way then.""\n\nYou get in your pod and lay down. ""Sweet dreams everyone,"" you hear Meat say right before your chamber shuts itself. \n\nSoon it's dark. You close your eyes. The world gets even darker.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, Meat, and Strauss are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nMen in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, Salvucci, and Strauss meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in merriment, celebrating your survival, though you allow yourselves to mournfully drink a round and say small eulogies for the dead: Ben, Markie, Neil, Ryan.\n\nWhen you're all finished, you share a cab that drops you off at your respective addresses. You're the first. Your comrades tell you to call them soon just to check in. Inside your small house in the suburbs, you finally allow yourself a good cry. Not for the dead. Not for any reason at all, in particular, except that it's been inside you for so long, struggling to get out.\n\nA week passes. You're relocated to an analyst position on the military base. You hear that Strauss is working at a research facility in New Memphis. You never talk to her, really, but Salvucci and Meat send you emails all the time. Both of them have been reassigned to on-base positions; Meat's an instructor, and Salvucci can't tell you what he does. You imagine it has something to do with what you found on earth.\n\nYears pass. You never marry or have children, but you're never alone. Boys come and go, at a rate of about one every five years. You become attached to them all and break down in sobs when each one leaves. You never tell any of your lovers about your experience aboard the Speedwell.\n\nYou and Meat become close. You meet twice a week for lunch. On Wednesdays, you watch sitcoms; on Fridays, there's salsa night downtown. You get a dog. This is your existence and it proceeds one day after another.\n\nYou grow old; it's inevitable. Salvucci dies first. You and Meat attend his funeral. You both take bets on who's next; turns out it's you.\n\nYou pass away one night in your sleep, your dog curled up behind you with his snout against your back, the hound peacefully unaware of your endless slumber.\n\nThe End\n"
"Save yourself; leave him to die.","It's a hard choice, but in the end, you get to your feet and sprint past the monster as it slaughters Meat. You can hear his screams as you run down the hall. Soon things are mercifully silent. \n\nYou climb up into the ventilation and decide to make your base of operations there. You're a survivor, you tell yourself. All you have to do is stay alive two months. That's all.\n\nYou go, day by day, into the ship in search of supplies. You often go to the mess hall to stock up on food and bring it back to the vents. You run into creature twice. Each time it's grown bigger, nastier. The first time, you get away without a scratch.\n\nThe second time, a tentacle pierces your ankle. You still manage to hop away, but you can't climb into the vent because of your injury. You seek refuge in the darkness of the barracks. Soon every breath brings pain. You refuse to accept the hand you've been dealt, even when Strauss, a bullet hole in her forehead, sits down beside you to have a chat.\n\n""You had a good run, idiot,"" she says. \n\n1.[[""You aren't real.""]]"
"""Yeah, no, fuck that.""","Markie slaps your arm. ""Don't be such a pussy, Zoe.""\n\nShe turns to the others.""Ryan, let Captain Salvucci know what we’ve found.

"Get out of there.","You both retreat. ""Neil,"" he yells into the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Markie running by herself--her suit covered in what appears to be blood. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You’ve covered half the distance to her when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach her, you take her by the arm and look through her visor. Her eyes are wild, and she's sweating.\n\n""Markie,"" Meat says, ""where's Ryan?""\n\nShe stutters. ""D...d..dead.""\n\n""Fuck!"" He turns back to the hole you and he emerged from. The wave of crabs has reached the mouth of the cave. In the light, they're purple and fungal looking.\n\nHe fires some shots at them while you tend to Markie. Her arm is wounded.\n\n1.[[""You alright?""]]\n2.[[Stay silent and keep your hand over the tear in her suit.]]"
"You go to the mess hall for a bite to eat.","The mess hall is rather small: two tables next to an enclosed kitchen. You find Meat sitting by himself, shoveling ramen into his mouth. A plastic cup filled with cheap whiskey is next to his arm. You grab your favorite snack, a box of soy oatmeal cookies, and take a seat.\n\nMeat looks up at you, eyes red, a weary expression.\n\n""Hell of a day, huh? Poor Ryan. How's Markie?""\n\n1.[[""Strauss is removing her arm.""]]\n2.[[""Not great.""]]\n\n\n"
"""He didn't.""","""Shit. We can't set this to autopilot or send out a distress beacon without access to that console.""\n\n""What's the trouble, cap?""

Do you know it?""\n\nMeat shakes his head.\n\n""Okay, what did we know about him?""\n\n""He liked video games,"" Meat offers, approaching the console.\n\nSalvucci slowly inputs ""FLAPPY BIRD XXXXXI.""\n\nACCESS DENIED, the screen reads.\n\n""Worth a shot.""\n\nYou all spend an hour typing various game titles, but none of them work. Eventually you give up and retire to the mess hall where Salvucci cooks hamburger meat for you both. \n\nYou eat quietly.\n\nThe next day you all try again with various game titles to no avail. \n\n""To think everything hinges on a goddamn video game,"" Meat says.\n\nFor days it goes like this, your ship still drifting in space. Eventually you run out of food. You all try for hours in desperation to magically conjure up the password, but it's no good. The three of you realize that at that point you're just making up titles that sound like video games: Masher Nasher, The Adventures of Wallaby Dingo.\n\nYou all make your way to the mess hall and sit quietly, removed from one another. You think of your home back on Mars. You're glad you didn't get a pet. You wonder if anyone besides your parents will mourn your passing. Will they ever even know? You stare out one of the hall's viewports into space, your grave. There are worse ways to die, you say to yourself, than floating among the stars. \n\nIt's hardly a comfort for you in the days to come. Eventually Salvucci takes his life, a gunshot ringing out on the far side of the ship, away from the mess hall, away from you and Meat.\n\n""You know,"" Meat says one day. ""I thought about eating you.""\n\n1.[[""Why didn't you?""]]\n2.[[""Not much to eat.""]]\n"
"Keep on going toward the mess hall.","""See,"" Meat says. ""Zoe says he'll be fine too. He's a big boy.""\n\nThe four of you make your way to the mess hall. \n\n""Check everything,"" Salvucci orders. You look around the tables and near the entertainment closest while Meat looks around the kitchen. Salvucci keeps his eyes on the door. Strauss sits at a table away from everyone.\n\nYou find a small bag of chips and pocket them. No monsters, though.\n\nMeat pokes his head out of the kitchen. ""Nothing."" He looks at all of you and shrugs his shoulders. ""What now?""\n\nAs if to answer him, a loud shriek erupts from the vent hanging over you all.\n\n""A GIFFTTTTT,"" Markie screams from the vent.\n\n""Oh god,"" Strauss says, backing into the wall.\n\n""Kill it,"" Salvucci says, raising his pistol. You, Meat, and Salvucci fire into the vent.\n\n""Don't waste your ammo. Just a few shots,"" Meat yells.\n\nYou fire half of your clip and lower your weapon. The vent cover drops to the floor. Meat and Salvucci lower their guns as well.\n\n""We got her, right?"" Meat says.\n\n""agiftagiftagiftagift,"" Markie answers from the vent.\n\n""Fuck me.""\n\n""agiftagiftagiftAGIFTAGIFTAGIFT,"" she screams. At first, you're not sure what falls from the vent.You see a small, almost circular object dropping through the air. When it hits the ground with a splat, you know what it is, but you can't bring yourself to look.\n\nStrauss' screams confirm your fears. You finally look down; it's Neil's head. Both his eyes have been gouged out and there's a jagged line of flesh and muscle where he was decapitated.\n\n""A GIFT!"" Markie yells once more before you hear her scamper away further into the ducts.\n\n""I told you,"" Strauss, the first to speak, says. ""We should have sent someone to look after him.\n\nMeat kicks over a table.\n\n""I told you!"" Strauss screams at him.\n\n""Doctor, quiet,"" Salvucci barks. He lowers his voice. ""We'll mourn later.""\n\n""If we fucking live that long,"" Meat says.\n\n""We have to trap it,"" Strauss says suddenly.\n\n""Go on, doctor,"" says Salvucci, still eyeing Neil's head.\n\n""I think it's pretty clear bullets aren't effective. We need to either space her or trap her in a tightly contained space and burn her.""\n\n""Risky options,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""For once, I'm in agreement with the good doctor.

Ben’s body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n""Well, that’s good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You step into the cockpit. The door slides shut behind you.\n\n""Here’s the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you.

Looking up, you see the thing step into view: it’s monstrous, with a muscular human abdomen. The thing’s face is distinctly unhuman with countless, slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster’s mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattle snake.\n\nYou turn to look at Meat. He's being lifted into the air by one of the tentacles. His face turns red; he's slowly being choked to death.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Save Meat's life.]]\n2.
