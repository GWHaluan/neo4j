"""Do you want to talk?""","She looks at you, tears in her eyes, and says ""I just want to sleep.""\n\nShe gets into her pod without another word. The hatch closes over her. You get in yours and close your eyes as the hatch seals. Sleep follows.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod. \n\nBoth you and Strauss are transported to private rooms on the biggest military outpost in New Texas. You order steak and wine but find that you don't have an appetite. Some suits interview you and, after you answer every question, you're told that you'll be allowed to leave soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days. You and Strauss meet on the base. She seems paler and thinner.\n\n""Can we get a drink?"" she asks. ""I just want to go somewhere, anywhere but home first.""\n\n1. [[Get a drink with Strauss]]\n2. [[Opt to go home.]]\n"
"Kill yourself.","No sense in delaying the inevitable, you suppose.\n\nYou press the gun against your temple and pull the trigger.

"""Don't get yourself killed.""","""Yeah, thanks,"" he says before heading out the other sickbay door. You step outside to find Salvucci loading his pistol.\n\n""Better to be safe than sorry. Do you have your pistol?""\n\nYou nod.\n\n""Good. Hopefully we won’t need it.""\n\nThe two of you walk down the hallway.

"""Fuck. Guess the old man was right.""","He sighs. ""I know.

He flops to the floor. You carefully step past him and look out into the darkness of space.\n\nYou realize the few loved ones you have at home will never know what happened to you. You will die a mystery.\n\nYou put the gun to your temple and pull the trigger.\n\nSeveral month later, the Speedwell tries to fly into the heart of the sun but is vaporized.\n\nThe End\n"
"""They're doing what?""","""Blowing it to smithereens. Higher-ups decided it was already a husk of a planet anyway. A fleet's heading there now; they're gonna bombard it until it's nothing but dust.

"""I needed to ensure my survival. I had to use her as bait.""","Your confession damns you. You're court-martialed and found guilty of murder in the first degree. You're sentenced to life aboard Titan penitentiary.\n\nYou live within the walls of this fine establishment for 63 more years. You learn to live without dignity and eventually, after a decade of abuse from both your inmates and the guards, earn your own amount of respect. An inmate doesn't like the way you look at her. She attacks you. You snap her neck.\n\nNo one messes with you anymore.\n\nYou spend the rest of your days caring for the community garden and reading literature in the library. No one comes to see you, which is fine. You've made it this far without people. You thrive in loneliness. At least, that's what you tell yourself.\n\nOne morning your cellmate, Lucca, tries wake you up only to find that you're not breathing. You're cold to the touch.

"""Yes, I’m fine.""","He gives a good natured smile, says ""Just wanted to make sure. You looked troubled.""\n\n""Stop trying to hit that, Ryan. It’s not gonna happen,"" says Markie, the Speedwell's science officer.\n\nRyan waves his hand dismissively.\n\nThe enforcer of the group, Meat, chuckles. ""She told you.""\n\n1.[[Nudge Markie and give her a wink of gratitude.]]\n2.[[Say nothing.]]\n"
"""Don't talk, okay?""","But he doesn't. ""Doctor Strauss left me here, and...and Markie chased her into the hallway. I can't believe she left me.""\n\nBefore you can say a word, something SLAMS into you, knocking you and the rifle across the floor. You look up. The rifle's light shines on Markie as she sits atop of Ben, a scalpel in her hand.  She’s giggling like a hyena. You can only see the side of her face but you know that your friend is gone. Blood and grime are dripping off her body, and her skin is peeling.\n\nAs if to remove all trace of doubt, the creature inside your friend speaks. ""Now now teacher’s pet, no one likes a suck-up!""\n\n""The hell?!"" Meat roars.\n\nThe thing slams the scalpel into Ben’s face, sinking the blade into his right eyeball.\n\n1. [[Rush her.]]\n2.

"""You too.""","You watch as Meat staggers out of the bar, hoping he calls a cab. You wait a ten more minutes to avoid any awkward post-goodbyes and then stumble outside yourself.\n\nA cab picks you up and takes you to your little house in the Martian suburbs.  You pay the cabbie and walk past your box—you’ll get the mail later—and inside your home.\n\nThe door slides shut. And that’s when you fall apart. You crumble to the floor and bawl yourself to sleep. You wake up in the night only to cry yourself asleep again.\n\nWhen you wake up, you want to believe it’s a new day but you can still feel the weight of the dead on your shoulders. It’s a weight you never learn to shake completely , but you grow accustomed to it: the night terrors, the sudden flashes of Ben dying in agony.\n\nMeat’s friendship and an ungodly amount of therapy helps you get through the trauma, as does Melissa, the woman who becomes your wife. The military sticks you with an analyst position, something you’re quite fine with, though it is boring work.\n\nYou grow older. Melissa talks about having kids.\n\n1. [[Have kids.]]\n2. [[Don't have kids.]]\n"
"""Captain, say something.""","""This is a bad horror movie,"" Ben moans, staring into the glass while Markie gazes at her own cauterized stump. She’s drooling now and has a nosebleed. You can see black veins popping beneath the skin on her forehead.\n\n""Enough,"" Salvucci says at last. ""We’re not killing anyone on my ship—we’re not savages.""\n\nMeat seems relived. ""Thanks, boss.""\n\n""This is a mistake,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Maybe,"" he says, ""but it’s my mistake to make, not yours. Do what you can to keep her alive and prep her for cryo sleep.""\n\n""Again, a mistake.""\n\n""Dr. Strauss, unless you want to be brought before a military tribunal for insubordination, I suggest you do as I say.\n\n""Yes, captain,"" she says, voice calm, but there’s a fire in her eyes. ""Ben, lower the temperature to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We’ll try to freeze her.""\n\nMarkie looks up at you all. A smile breaks out over her face and then she leans over and pukes.\n\n""Disgusting creature,"" Strauss mutters.\n\n""Travis, Julia, to the cockpit,"" Salvucci says.\n\n1. [[Go to the cockpit.]]"
"""Let’s go hunting.""","""I like the sound of that!"" Meat says, slapping your back.\n\n""Hunt it with what, precisely? You shot it in the head, right?"" Strauss says.\n\n""Yeah.""\n\n""It got back up, right?""\n\n""Yeah, but this time I'll make it stay dead.""\n\n""With fire? You ignorant ape, what if those bodies are toxic? What if we inhale viruses?""\n\n""Doc, it's not that fucking hard. We set them on fire and then close the door. We lock the room, don't enter it for the rest of the voyage home.""\n\n""This is a horrible plan.""\n\n""Well, doctor Strauss,"" Salvucci interjects, ""do you have another plan in mind?""\n\nShe looks at the floor and then back at him. ""No. I don't, in fact.""\n\n""Then you're not giving us much of a choice."" \n\n""Should we split up to cover more ground?"" Meat asks.\n\n""No. I think we'll all stay together for this.

"Blast it.","You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He’s a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body’s back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren’t far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Strauss and Meat are looking over the bloody hole in Neil’s chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil’s mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I’m so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn’t fast enough…""\n\n""Stop talking, sweetie,"" Strauss says, taking you by surprise with the earnest care in her voice as she examines the wound. ""An artery’s been pierced.""\n\n""Shit, is there anything you can do for him?""\n\nStrauss looks at you both, clearly not wanting to give her answer in front of Neil. You feel a tap on your arm. Neil looks up at you.\n\n""Zoe, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is…"" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I. Got it?""\n\n1.[[""Yeah. I understand.""]]"
"Burn it.","""I'm a fan of anything that doesn't include the possibility of us getting sucked out into space.""\n\n""We just might catch the whole ship on fire is all,""  Salvucci says.\n\n""Not if we do it right. We need to trap it in sickbay, where the extra cryopod is.""\n\n""Isn't that one broken?"" Meat  asks.\n\n""Yeah, which is perfect for us.""\n\n""I thought we were going to use fire?""\n\n""We are. Just...just trust me, okay?""\n\n Salvucci nods. ""Okay, doctor. What do we need to do.""\n\n""Give me your gun. I'm gonna run ahead and try and get it to follow.""\n\n""That's insane!"" Meat yells\n\n""It's already established I'm the weakest out of all of us. It'll track me. You guys follow behind at a distance and when you get there, you do exactly as I say, okay?""\n\nSalvucci hands her his pistol. ""Stay safe,"" he says.\n\nShe nods. She goes to the door. ""Doc,"" Meat says. She turns, hand on the door.\n\n""Be careful, okay?""\n\n""Thanks.""\n\n1.[[""Don't get killed.""]]\n2.[[""Keep one bullet in the chamber for yourself...just in case.""]]\n\n"
"""You aren't real.""","""No,"" she says, turning away from you. ""But it is.""\n\nYou turn just in time to make out the tentacle that rends your head from your body.\n\nThe last sound you hear is the beast roaring with satisfaction.\n\nThe End\n"
"""See you at home.""","You slide into your chamber and the hatch closes. You quickly fall into slumber. When you wake up, you're surounded by soldiers. One of them, a corporal, is saying something but his words are soundless. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, and Meat are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. All of you are given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nJust as Meat said, men in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, and Salvucci meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in almost complete silence, only uttering the names of the lost from time to time.\n\nYou all take seperate cabs home. When you reach your house in the suburbs, you pass your mailbox but decide to check it later. It's only when you swipe your card against the door's reader and hear it unlock that you feel as though you are truly safe. Inside, you shut the door and hang up your coat.\n\nYou go into the living room and sit on the couch. You do nothing but stare at the wall for hours, in a trance of sorts. You rub you finger up and down one of the cushions of your couch. You are alive to do this, but you're not sure you're thankful for that.\n\nYou begin to see a therapist. You make progress--according to him, anyway. You never really shake the memories of your time aboard the Speedwell, but you're able to cope with them.\n\nThat's more than can be said for Captain Salvucci, who eats \na bullet on the third anniversary of your return to Mars.\n\nYou don't go to the funeral.\n\nYou and Meat stay in contact but the emails you send one another are largely going through the motions bullshit. Your failure to connect with him is indicative of your relationship with the rest of humankind. You never marry or even begin what you're comfortable calling a relationship with anyone. For the first ten years or so this bothers you but you slowly grow comfortable with this new you.\n\nYou become a writer. Your sci-fi espionage novels sell well enough for you to live comfortably by yourself and away from everyone. You're mostly happy but sometimes there's a thought strikes you like the lash of a whip.\n\nYou are alone.\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n\n"
"""You’re right. She’s probably dead.""","You open your mouth to speak, but you're cut off by a familiar voice.  ""Well, captain, I guess it’s too much to hope for some confidence in my abilities.""\n\nOut from a supply closet steps Strauss.  Sweat is dripping off her face; there’s blood on her lab coat.\n\n""Doctor, are you hurt?""\n\n""No,"" she says. ""It broke through the glass and grabbed me, but Ben pushed it off. I ran and didn’t look back. I heard him scream behind me.""\n\nSalvucci looks at you nervously.\n\n1.\t[[""Ben’s dead.""]]\n2.\t[[""You left him to die, you bitch.""]]\n\n"
"""That's what you get.""","""Please hurry,"" she begs. ""We’re in the cockpit.""\n\n""Hustle people,"" Meat says, breaking out into a sprint.\n\nYou and Neil follow.\n\nYou keep an eye out for Markie, but, thankfully, she never exploits your panic. When you reach the bend before the cockpit, Meat slows down and raises his hand for you to stop. You do so and listen. Just out of sight, you can hear something cracking.\n\nMeat steps out of the corner, and his face goes pale. You and Neil join him, your pistol raised in the direction of the cockpit. There, covered in red and yellow grime, his back to you, is Ben biting into Salvucci’s leg and tearing away flesh and muscle. Salvucci is against the cockpit’s door, either unconscious or dead. Blood trickles from his forehead. A crowbar is on the ground next to him.\n\nMeat aims down the sight and breathes hard.\n\n""Conserve the ammo,"" Neil says.\n\nMeat gently tugs the trigger. A round slams into Ben’s neck; the creature masquerading in your crewmate’s skin whirls around and slams into the wall. It hisses and stands up. What was once Ben’s youthful face glares at you. \n\nThe thing takes a step forward.\n\nMeat fires another two shots that slam into its chest. Ben is knocked back, but he recovers quickly, taking another step toward you. And then another. He’s closing in.\n\n""Well don’t just stand there—shoot him!""\n\nYou aim down the sight of your pistol.\n\n1. [[Pull the trigger.]]\n"
"""Yeah. You too, doc.""","When you get inside your house, you finally allow yourself to break down and cry. For the dead, for you, for Strauss.\n\nIt takes years for you to come to terms with the fact that you're alive. You see a therapist to help you cope with the nightmares and PTSD episodes. You are reassigned to a boring job as an analyst, an occupation you're fine with. You never marry, though you do have a series of healthy relationships with their ups and downs.\n\nTwenty years later, Strauss sends you an email out of the blue; ""I'm sorry"" is all it says. The next morning the local news reports the suicide of a renowned doctor. You turn off the TV before the anchor says her name. Though you never really talked after the Speedwell incident, you can't help but feel that your universe is a little smaller without Lenore Strauss in it.\n\nYou are now alone.\n\nThe End\n"
"""Don't let it eat you.""","""Thanks,"" she says. She leaves the mess hall. You hear her break out into a run, her footsteps echoing through the hall.\n\n""Help!"" she shrieks as she runs. ""Help!""\n\nTime passes painfully, slowly. Finally, Salvucci turns to both of you. ""We go. Now.""\n\nAll of you start running toward the hanger. ""Keep an eye out for anything,"" Salvucci says. ""It might try to use this plan against us.""\n\nYou reach the hanger in two minutes. You all peek through the threshold to see Markie advancing on a bloodied Strauss, who has her back to the hanger door. The captain's pistol lay on the floor several feet from the pair.\n\n""She's wounded,"" Meat says, defeated. ""Infected.""\n\nMarkie is shuffling closer, giggling. Strauss sees the three of you. She looks over at the panel that controls the hanger door and then looks back at you all. She nods.\n\nYou slowly raise your pistol. Markie grabs the doctor by the throat and lifts her into the air. She chokes her.\n\nMeat raises his rifle. His hands are shaking.\n\n1. [[Mercy kill Strauss first.]]\n2. [[Go ahead and shoot the switch.]]"

You try to make your way through a collection of Christine Love’s works, but you keep losing your focus.\n\nDeath comes when you’re sitting in your loveseat watching a news report on a bridge being built in a neighboring county. It is a quick, painful tremor that starts in your chest and spreads out.\n\nThe dark sets in. You never expected slipping away to be this easy.\n\n\nThe End\n"
"""That’s good and all, but what about Markie?""","We have to euthanize her,"" Strauss says, looking through the glass at Markie. ""The infection could spread.""\n\n""I thought you chopped her damn arm off so that wouldn’t happen.""\n\n""The possibility of infection still remains and, as I’m sure Julia can attest to, officer Daniels has only worsened in the past half hour.

You see Meat being held up by two soldiers. He’s grinning like a fool.\n\n""We did it,"" his eyes say.\n\nThe troops escort you both to your own personal rooms where you’re served cheap stake and soda pop. It tastes superb. \n\nLater, you and Meat are interviewed about the incident aboard the Speedwell. You both answer the interviewer, an older man with a bald spot, as honestly as you can.\n\nAnd then he shows you security footage of Meat killng Strauss...while you and Neil look on.\n\n""Explain,"" he says. Before you can even say anything, Meat jumps in. ""She killed the captain. She would have killed us too if she saw us as obstacles to her survival. You bet I put her the fuck down.""\n\nAnd just like that, his confession damns you. You're both court-martialed. Meat gets life. You get a hard 25 without parole in Titan penitentiary. You don't make the 25. You don't even make five.\n\nWhen you refuse the courtship of one of the most powerful inmates in the penitentiary, she has one of her thugs stab you in your throat while you're taking a shower.\n\nAs the blood and suds and water swishes all around you on the way to the drain, you look up at your nude attacker. On her calf, you see a tattoo of an angel and a demon dancing around a single word: ""Karma.""\n\nYou almost want to laugh. Almost.\n\nThe End\n"
"Put a bullet in your brain.","You can't kill them. You thought you could, but you're not strong enough.

""Ocelot.""\n\nThe door slides open, and Neil's boyish face is there to greet you. ""Heard gunshots. You guys killin' things out here?""\n\nSalvucci cuts to the chase. ""Doctor Strauss, Ben, and Markie are dead. Whatever killed them is still on the ship, dressed in Markie's skin.""\n\nNeil looks at you all from left to right. ""You guys are fucking with me, right?""\n\n""Does it look like we're yanking your chain, Neil?"" Meat growls, pointing to his gore-covered boot.\n\nHe gulps. ""No, I guess not.

The thing that was Markie topples over to the ground, blood spewing out of her nose and mouth as it giggles.\n\nThe red eyes roll around in her head like in a slot machine before settling on you.\n\n""Buy two hypostims, get three free. Just come on down to the Couponia at Rylock’s junction this Saturday—""\n\nSalvucci puts another bullet in its face. Markie jerks and then stops moving completely.\n\nMeat bends down to examine Ben.

You try to make your way through a collection of Christine Love’s works, but you keep losing your focus.\n\nDeath comes when you’re sitting in your loveseat watching a news report on a bridge being built in a neighboring county.

"Shoot her!","You fire several rounds as well, tearing off her other arm. Still, the body convulses. You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He’s a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body’s back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and darts into the kitchen. You aren’t far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Meat is looking over the bloody hole in Neil’s chest.

The claw is surprisingly quick as it rips open your throat.\n\n""Julia!"" Meat cries, but you know you're a goner. You watch helplessy as Salvucci and Meat both tackle her.

It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they’re pulled as well.  \n\nA moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster’s fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm.

You're already dying when you hit the ground.\n\nAs police officers gather to get a good look at you, all you can do is wonder what they'll say about you on the morning news.\n\nThe End\n\n"

"""Come on. Let’s get out of the hanger.""","""Yeah, let’s.""\n\nThe two of you walk back through the hallway leading to the hanger and then to the cockpit.

"Wink at Markie in appreciation.","""No problem,"" she says.\n\n""What was that?"" Ryan asks.\n\n""We’re coming up on that big-ass hole,"" Markie says. ""You big bad men got your willy compensators charged?""\n\n""Ha. Ha. Ha,"" Ryan says.\n\n""Oh you bet, baby,"" Meat says, showing off the rifle in his hands. ""32 round clip, full metal jacket. Enough stopping power to put down a rhinoceros.""\n\n""A rhywhat?""\n\n""Didn’t you pay attention in school at all? A rhinoceros, man. It’s a huge fucking lizard that ruled over all the other dinosaurs.""\n\n1. [[Say nothing at all.]]\n2.[[""You're talking about a trout, Meat, you dumbass.""]]"
"""Things that are not great ideas: this.""","""Everything will be fine,"" Markie says.\n\nThe groups go their separate ways; you hike down the cliff with Markie. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel. You step inside.\n\n""Let's turn our lights on,"" Markie says quietly.\n\nYou both tell your suits to turn on your light attachments. Yours flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\nOn the Head Up Display (HUD) of your helmet, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. Yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\nYou proceed through the cave.\n\n""These caverns are massive. This one seems to just go on and on.""\n\n1.[[""What made them?""]]"
"""God damn it. I'm so sorry, Neil.""","You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nYou look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over.\n \n1. [[Comfort him by touching his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Let him get it out of his system.]]\n"
"""Should we go investigate?""","""Fuck that!"" Meat says, turning. He aims his assault rifle at the first speaker and dismembers it with a single shot. He takes the second, third speakers out of commission as well. The music is no longer overpowering, but you can hear its echoes in the hallway.\n\n""Brutal, but effective,"" Strauss comments.\n\nSalvucci frowns. ""You’re footing the bill for that when we get back.""\n\n""Guys, now that Julia is awake, I think we should talk strategy. I just finished with our travel projections,"" Neil says.\n\n""And?"" Strauss says, as though she knows what’s coming next.\n\n""Well, it’s like you said, doc: not good. Two months to Mars.""\n\n""We could last that long,"" Salvucci says. ""We ration food, ammo, go in groups to the rest of the ship when we need supplies.""\n\n""Captain, permission to speak?"" Meat says.\n\nSalvucci nods.\n\n""That’s a horrible idea. We’ve got guns. Why don’t we use them? For all we know, that beastie thing could be growing. We need to hunt it down and kill it now.""\n\n""Travis, I put a gun against Markie’s head and blew her brains all over the floor. Apparently the thing inside her shook it off. I don’t think bullets are going to save us.""\n\n""Then we destroy the body completely,"" Meat suggests. ""Shoot it, stomp it, burn it, and then jettison the motherfucker into space.""\n\n""Captain, I don’t like either choice, but I think the more cautious one would be eliminating its presence from the ship,"" Strauss says slowly.\n\n""Didn’t you say something about it being airborne?"" Salvucci asks. ""Could killing it infect one of us?""\n\nStrauss sighs, shrugs. ""There’s no way to be sure. I didn’t get to run any tests on it. However, I’d rather take a chance on that possibility than risk us starving ourselves into easy prey.""\n\nSilence fills the common room. Then—\n\n""What do you think, Julia?"" Neil asks.\n\nEveryone turns to you.\n\n1.[[""Let’s kill it.""]]\n2.[[""Let’s wait it out.""]]\n\n"
"""She won’t.""","""Let's burn it. Just to be sure."" Twenty minutes later, he’s scavenged the supplies for another Molotov. \n\nBoth of you return to Strauss’ body. You watch silently as it burns.\n\n""We shouldn’t move the bodies,"" he says. ""Might make us sick or something. Be a fucking shame to die over a little infection at this point,"" he says, attempting to smile, but he can’t manage it. The will to smile or laugh has gone out of both of you at this point. \n\nWhat future awaits you both now?\n\nYou both return to your cryo tubes and pop them open. They hiss and spew cold air on you.\n\n""Two months,"" he says as he stares at his tube, which you realize now looks very much like a coffin. ""Here’s hoping nothing eats us while we’re sleeping.""\n\nHe gets in his. You follow suit.\n\n""See you soon, kid.""\n\nYou press the button on the interior of the door and it slowly closes on your tube. You hear the seal clamp.

"""Never.""","""I dream of them from time to time,"" he says.\n\nThat’s all he says on the matter. The week passes. He leaves.

"""What is that?""","She appraises you with a cold glare, like you're a fly that's landed on her sandwich.\n\n""What does it look like?""\n\nShe scoots past you and turns on the device in her hand. A hot laser point darts out about three inches from the top port of the device. Another line escapes the bottom port and swings upward to connect to the top beam.\n\n""Cauterizing saw.

"Read the text on the screen.","Tell it to me again. \n\nTell you what again?\n\nYou know.\n\nDarling, I don't.\n\nI want the story.\n\nNot that story.\n\nYes.

"""What’s going on?""","""It’s been in Neil’s room. Somehow it’s hooked up all his music to the PA system and is playing it. This is the third song.""\n\nYou look over at Neil. He shrugs sheepishly.

"Have kids.","You and Melissa adopt, opting not to go with artificial insemination. His name is Andre, he’s seven, and unruly like most young boys. He grows into a fine young man.

"Sulk in silence.","""Guess not,"" he says, seeing the expression on your face. \n\n""I'll just go over here and play with this tablet.""\n\n""Moron,"" you hear Strauss mutter.\n\nYou take a seat on the examination table and look around the wrecked room. You're staring at the bloodstains left by Ben's corpse when the door opens and in walk Meat and Salvucci; both men were dark expressions.\n\n""I’m guessing your hunt was uneventful?"" Strauss says.\n\n""Yeah, go on and rub it in then,"" Meat says, turning to rifle through the medical cabinets.\n\n""What are you looking for?""\n\n""Food.""\n\n""This is a medical facility. What makes you think there’s food in here?""\n\nMeat opens one of the lower cabinets and, after a moment, pulls out a large bag of apricot chips.\n\n""Your assistant told me about his stash a while back.""\n\n""I’m glad you can eat his food while his remains are in the same room as you.""\n\n""Not like he’s going to need them,"" Meat says with a shrug.\n\n""Enough you two,"" Salvucci barks.

"Run!","You flee.\n\nLooking over your shoulder, you watch as what’s left of Ryan is pulled out of sight. His heart monitor flatlines.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you eventually stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie.\n\nBehind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the ground. You run toward your squadmates. You’ve covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach them, Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fires several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie’s arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your pistol and bash the monster’s dome in. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived; Meat puts three rounds into the soft belly.\n\n""Fucking fuck."" He kicks the crab.\n\nYou turn to Markie, who’s holding her arm. \n\n1.[[""Is your suit ripped?""]]"

"Draw the monster out.","""Okay, with what?"" Neil asks.\n\nThere’s a moment of silence as you, Meat, and Strauss turn to look at Neil. \n\n""Oh,"" he says, getting it. ""Well fuck that.""\n\n1.[[""Don't be a wuss. This is your chance to be a man.""]]\n2.[[""We could just knock you out.""]]"
"Go home.","""Yeah, that might be best for both of us."" You share a cab. The cabbie drops you off at your home in the suburbs.\n\n""Hey,"" Meat says as you get out of the cab. You turn. ""Give me a call if you need anything, okay?""\n\n1.[[""You too, okay?""]]\n2. [[Nod at him.]]\n\n"

"""Nothing we can do about it, Meat.""","""I know you're right, but..still. It's our homeworld.""\n\nYou both return to your group of friends to find that Neil is mooning the barkeep.\n\nWeeks pass. One day you see a report about Earth destructing. ""An issue with the core,""  says the handsome anchor. No one mentions monsters. No mentions of nukes or fleets of war crusiers. It stirkes you that no one will ever know the sacrifices of you or your crew. You weep and Michelle asks what's wrong.\n\nYou lie. Just as you do when she asks you about the augmentations. Accident in the cryotube, you tell her.\n\nYou're so wracked with guilt over these lies that you make it a priority to never lie to her about anything. For the most part, your relationship is one built on trust.\n\nThree years after your return to Mars you're married. It's a simple ceremony. Your parents show up, as do the surviving members of your crew. You eat cake. You kiss.\n\nMichelle moves in with you. You live a comfortable life together. She starts talking about children and you make efforts to put off that conversation for as long as possible.\n\nOne day, the two of you take a trip to the recently terraformed beach. There's a moment where you're looking out across the manufactured ocean of Mars. You know the ocean is fake, but you can't help but admire its beauty. This is your new life, you tell youself. It's one you've made for yourself, and you've earned every second of it.\n             \nThe End\n"
"Shoot the viewport.","You unload your clip into the window. On the fourth shot you hear a sucking sound. \n\nBingo.\n\nThe doctor leaps back behind the door's threshold. You smash the button and the emergency door comes down between the two of you and the beast. It wastes no time in striking at the door with its tentacles. You watch through the glass in the door as the viewport's glass cracks, shatters, and is sucked into space. The monster, though it tries to cling to the inside of the ship with its appendages, isn't far behind.\n\n""We did it,"" Strauss says, relieved. The alarms blare for a few minutes until the emergency panel comes down and covers where the viewport was.\n\nThe door in front of you lifts, giving you access to the rest of the ship again.\n\n""I guess we should burn the other bodies. Just to be sure. I'll go to the lab and make some molotovs. You go get our cryopods ready.""\n\n1.[[Go ready for the cryopods for the two of you.]]\n"
"Peer down.","It’s Ben. There’s a giant slash across his cheek and his eyes are wide with fear, but he’s alive. You lean down to help him to his feet. You tug but he doesn’t get up. He whimpers in pain.

"Run.","You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He’s a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body’s back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren’t far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Strauss and Meat are looking over the bloody hole in Neil’s chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil’s mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I’m so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn’t fast enough…""\n\n""Stop talking, sweetie,"" Strauss says, taking you by surprise with the earnest care in her voice as she examines the wound. ""An artery’s been pierced.""\n\n""Shit, is there anything you can do for him?""\n\nStrauss looks at you both, clearly not wanting to give her answer in front of Neil. You feel a tap on your arm. Neil looks up at you.\n\n""Julia…Julia, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is…"" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I.' Got it?""\n\n1.[[""Yeah, I got it.""]]"
"""When I wake up, I expect to have kickass robo-limbs.""","Meat smiles and closes the pod. A moment exists between when the gas floods your chamber and when you wake up in a hospital bed on an army base in New Austin. A brief, dark moment.\n\n""Hello, Julia, your doctor says with a friendly smile. ""We took the liberty of installing your augmentations while you were under a delayed cryo release,"" she says. She has pretty eyes, and she's blonde. You were always a sucker for blondes.\n\nSome suits come by a day later and ask you for your official account of what happened aboard the Speedwell. You tell them everything, although you feel like a loony. They thank you for your time and leave you to rest.\n\nLess than a week later, you're released from the care unit. The doctor comes to visit you to perform a final checkup.\n\n1. [[Ask her for her name.]]\n2. [[Thank her for taking care of you.]]"
"""I will.""","When you get inside your house, you finally allow yourself to break down and cry. For the dead, for you, for Strauss.\n\nIt takes years for you to come to terms with the fact that you're alive. You see a therapist to help you cope with the nightmares and PTSD episodes. You are reassigned to a boring job as an analyst, an occupation you're fine with. You never marry, though you do have a series of healthy relationships with their ups and downs.\n\nTwenty years later, Strauss sends you an email out of the blue; ""I'm sorry"" is all it says. The next morning the local news reports the suicide of a renowned doctor. You turn off the TV before the anchor says her name. Though you never really talked after the Speedwell incident, you can't help but feel that your universe is a little smaller without Dr. Lenore Strauss in it.\n\nYou are now alone.\n\nThe End"
"Sacrifice yourself for humanity.","You awaken in sickbay. Meat is standing over you, a relieved expression on his face.

""Yeah, between Neil and I we managed to get that on your forehead. Nasty cut. Probably should get the doctors to look at it when get back to Mars.""\n\nYou eye the pistol in his holster and then look up into his eyes.
