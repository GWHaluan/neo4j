"""You only did what you had to.""","""I guess so. Still. I wish things could have been different.""\n\nYou sip your drinks without another word until it's time to go. The cabbie takes you home first.\n\n""Julia,"" Strauss says. ""Take care, okay?""\n\n1. [[""Thanks, doc.""]]\n2. [[""I will.""]]"
"""I didn't.""","""If it’s not dead, we’re fucked. All we got left is your pistol. I’m guessing you’re down to two clips.""\n\nYou pop the clip out of your pistol to show him it’s the last one.\n\n""Shit.""\n\n""We don’t know if it’s alive. If it is, we’ll improvise.""\n\n""Great, I wonder who’ll die next time thanks to our masterful improvisation abilities.""\n\nStrauss says nothing. \n\nA few minutes later you reach the cockpit door. Ben’s body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n\n""Well, that’s good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You notice that Strauss is deliberately looking away from Ben’s smashed skull.\n\nThe three of you step into the cockpit. You slam the door behind you.\n\n""Here’s the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you. You type in ""KONAMI.""\n\nThe screen changes to a selection of menus.\n\n""There’s the autopilot,"" says Strauss. She touches the screen and selects NEW AUSTIN.""\n\n""We done?"" Meat asks.\n\n""Yeah, I think we’re set.""\n\n""Good.""\n\nAll of you approach the door.\n\n""Now let’s get out of here before that fucking thing corn—"" \n\nA tentacle sweeps through the door as soon as it opens and brushes all of you aside with a mighty swing. You all going flying across the room. You slam into the viewport, cracking the glass, and then fall to the floor. Looking up, you see the thing step into view: it’s monstrous, with a muscular human abdomen. \n\nThe monster's face is distinctly unhuman with countless slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster’s mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattlesnake.\n\n""No!"" you hear Strauss scream as one of the tentacles darts out and wraps itself around her neck.  It lifts her into the air and pulls her toward its master. You turn to look at Meat who’s paralyzed with fear, watching one of the tentacles dance above him.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Save Meat.]]\n2. [[Save Strauss.]]\n3. [[Save yourself.]]\n"
"Draw it out.","""Okay, with what?"" Neil asks.\n\nThere’s a moment of silence as you, Meat, and Strauss turn to look at Neil. \n\n""Oh,"" he says, getting it. ""Well fuck that.""\n\n1.[[""Don’t be a baby.""]]\n2.[[""We could just knock you out.""]]\n\n\n"
"""Something happened, huh?""","""The infection spread,"" Strauss explains.\n\n""What fucking infection?"" Meat interjects.\n\nStrauss turns her cold gaze onto him. ""I don’t know precisely what is in her body, Travis. What I do know is that once I amputated her arm, it lunged at my throat.""\n\n""Bullshit.""\n\n""No, it’s…it’s…true,"" Ben stammers. ""It’s over there. Look.""\n\nThere, lying on the ground, is an arm with shriveled fingers caked in yellow ooze. You can barely make out three bullet holes.\n\n""Lenore says that Ben saved her life by putting it down,"" Salvucci explains.\n\n1.[[""What about Markie?""]]\n2.[[""Nice job, shrimp. Didn't think you had it in you.""]]"
"""Nobody could have predicted that.""","He doesn't meet your eyes and offers no reply.\n\n""He gave you a password, right?"" Strauss says. ""Maybe there’s an autopilot sequence on his computer.""\n\n""Doesn’t do us any good if that thing is still stomping around.""\n\n""Do you really think it survived that blast?""\n\n""Is that a serious question?""\n\n""Either way, we need to get the ship moving. Let’s get to the cockpit and decide what to do there.""\n\nYou make your way toward the cockpit. About halfway there, Meat speaks. ""What was it doing when it killed Neil?""\n\n""Evolving,"" Strauss answers.\n\n""Did you get a good look at it?"" Meat asks.\n\n1.[[""I didn't.""]]\n2.[[""It had a lot of tentacles.""]]\n"
"Shoot Markie.","""Here’s what we’re going to do,"" Salvucci starts. \n\nThe sudden discharge of your pistol cuts him off. The first two rounds shatter the quarantine glass. You approach the cube. \n\nSomeone—Meat perhaps?—is shouting something, but it’s too late. You're raising your gun, leveling it at Markie’s head. She looks up at you, uncomprehending.\n\nYou fire once. A mixture of red and yellow liquid spills out of the back of her head as her body crumples. The smell is excruciating. You gag. And that’s when Meat smashes the butt of his rifle into your face.\n\nYou black out.\n\nYou wake up two months later in a prison cell where Salvucci, with a mixture of sympathy and disgust hiding behind his blue eyes, explains how they put you in cryo sleep for the rest of the journey home and how now you will be brought before a military tribunal for the murder of your crewmember.\n\nHe refuses to listen when you try to explain your actions and offers you only one comfort before leaving: he hears your lawyer is pretty damn good.\n\nAnd she is. She’s a looker and has a brain to match. She manages to convince the court that you committed, not murder, but manslaughter out of concern for your crew. You serve five years at Titan penitentiary and earn the good will of the prisoner population by teaching them science and mathematics, and regaling them with stories of your travels.\n\nUpon release, you can’t find a job teaching at any of the universities on Mars or even the terraformed moons. Finally, a desperate temp agency takes a chance on you and you end up working as a secretary for an accounting office in New Memphis. They eventually hire you full-time and, despite being miserable, you never look for another job out of fear of rejection.\n\nEventually you get lonely and give Meat a call, hoping to reconcile. He’s not there. You leave a message, but he never calls back. You have night terrors and imagine Markie’s face, her yellow eyes, staring at you from the darkness. \n\nWhen you were younger, you told yourself you’d never be a cat lady, so you become a lizard lady instead. Most of your free time and fun money are dedicated to purchasing and raising as many types of reptiles as possible. The chameleon Toro is your prized pet.\n\nFinally, some fifty years after you killed Markie, you begin to feel life slip away from you. You’re not sure if it’s disease or depression or some form of universal comeuppance, but you let yourself go piece by piece. However, you’re defiant all the way to the end. ""I did the right thing,"" you mutter to yourself. ""I saved lives."" \n\nSoon you fall into eternal rest. Your lizards are not far behind.\n\nThe End\n"
"""It might be Ben.""","""Even better,"" Meat says grimly.\n\n""Let’s just shut down the computer,"" Neil says.\n\n""It’s your computer. After you, your majesty.""\n\n""Oh no, you’ve got the gun. You go first. Please, I insist.""\n\nMeat grumbles as he steps past Neil and peers into the room. You see him flip on the light attached to the rifle.\n\n""See anything?""\n\n""No, but it’s dark. There’s shattered glass on the floor—probably the lights."" He creeps into the room slowly. \n\nYou and Neil follow.\n\nRemember me to the one who lives there…\n \nThe room is pitch black except for the light coming from the computer terminal next to Neil’s bed. The computer, a custom built powerhouse, sits on the floor and is connected to an obnoxiously large, wall-mounted flat screen. On the screen, you see a music library. Meat flashes his light across the floor. There’s at least 11 or 12 footsteps separating you and the terminal, a no-man’s land of shattered glass and possible traps.\n\n""Well,"" Neil says after a moment. ""I guess one of us should cross—""\n\nGunfire cuts off Neil’s sentence as Meat fires three rounds into the terminal. The music dies abruptly.\n\n""Are you fucking kidding me?!""  Neil erupts. ""That was two months worth of pay! It was like, the ultimate fucking entertainment system!""\n\nYou can’t make out Meat’s expression in the dark but you can tell he’s not in the mood to deal with Neil’s shit. ""Listen, if we get out of this alive, I’ll buy you a new toy, okay?""\n\n""It was brand new!""\n\n""Shut up. Did you hear that?""\n\nYou listen. You hear nothing, not the crackling of glass, or an insidious snicker. \n\n""Let’s go,"" says Meat. You all turn, and, of course, there she is, standing next to the door.\n\nNeil gasps in horror. Markie smiles at all of you, the hallway light shining on her face to reveal rotting flesh and a dangling eyeball. Her arm stump oozes yellow.\n\nMeat raises his rifle, but he’s too slow. She slams the door.\n\nYou’re locked in here with her.\n\n1. [[ Pull out your pistol and fire blindly.]]\n2. [[Panic and run.]]\n\n\n\n"
"""It's trying to scare us.""","""Well, we’re about to put an end to that shit,"" Meat says as you approach the crew’s quarters. You see large cables running through the doorway; they lead up the wall and into the ceiling.\n\nNeil reaches up and runs his hand along the cables. He quickly pulls it back. ""Augh! Fuck!""\n\n""What is it?"" Meat barks.\n\n""Nothing,"" Neil says, regaining his composure. ""Just fucking slime. Oh god, gag a maggot,"" he says. ""This shit reeks."" He holds his hand up to the light to reveal a goopy, transparent liquid.\n\n""Hey, that looks a little bit like—""\n\n""Don’t you say it, Travis.""\n\nYou examine the cables without touching them.\n\nMeat takes a look as well. ""Seems like a complicated operation.""\n\n""What, turning on the computer, starting a program, and plugging in some cables?""\n\nMeat turns. ""You didn’t see how feral this thing was—not to mention she’s missing a goddamn arm.""\n\n1.[[""Could be Ben.""]]\n"
"""Yeah. I understand.""","""Good. Give me your gun and turn the gas on before you leave.""\n\n""There’s no way out except through the front.""\n\n""Vent,"" he says, pointing at a vent near one of the stoves. ""…Gotta crawl fast. I’ll give you as much time as I can.""\n\nA clanging at the door. Whatever was inside Markie is now trying to get in the kitchen.\n\n""This ain’t fucking right, man. It’s not right at all.""\n\n""Just give me your damn gun, dude."" He coughs. Meat, with reluctance, takes the pistol from his holster and sticks it in Neil’s hand. \n\nStrauss quickly turns on all the gas stoves in the room.\n\nAnother bang at the door. The tip of a tentacle pierces the door and writhes wildly about, slapping a nearby wall.\n\n""Go,"" Neil says, fighting to stay conscious.\n\n1.[[""We fucked things up for you. I'm sorry.""]]\n2. [[Say nothing to him. Leave.]]"
"""Deal.""","""Seriously though, I wonder if we’ll find anything down here.  I still think it’s erosion. I mean, sure, these tunnels are uh pretty deep, I guess, but erosion can do that, right? Erosion. Yeah.""\n\nYou continue on, the darkness before you disappearing to reveal only more darkness. Your suit tells you that ten minutes have passed, but it feels like an age. Ryan’s chatter isn’t helping.\n\n""Hey, has Markie talked you about me at all? Actually, better question: do you know if she’s dating anyone? I mean, back on Mars.""\n\n1.\t[[""I don’t know.""]]\n2.\t[[""I don’t know, you fucking horndog.""]]\n3.\t[[""Grow some balls and ask her yourself.""]]\n"
"""I needed to ensure my survival. She was bait.""","Your confession damns you. You're court-martialed and found guilty of murder in the first degree. You're sentenced to life aboard Titan penitentiary.\n\nYou live within the walls of this fine establishment for 63 more years. You learn to live without dignity and eventually, after a decade of abuse from both your inmates and the guards, earn your own amount of respect. An inmate doesn't like the way you look at her. She attacks you. You break her neck by pushing her over a bannister. \n\nNo one messes with you anymore.\n\nYou spend the rest of your days caring for the community garden and reading literature in the library. No one comes to see you, which is fine. You've made it this far without people. You thrive in loneliness. At least, that's what you tell yourself to keep away the tears at night.\n\nOne morning your cellmate, Lucca, tries wake you up only to find that you aren't breathing. You're cold to the touch. ""She's dead,"" she yells at a nearby guard. ""This bitch is dead!""\n\nThe End\n"

"""You finally turn out to be useful.""","She turns away from you and leaves the mess hall. You hear her break out into a run, her footsteps echoing through the hall.\n\n""Help!"" she shrieks as she runs. ""Help!""\n\n""Five minutes,"" Meat says, ""then we go after her.""\n\nTime passes painfully, slowly. Finally, Salvucci turns to both of you. ""We go. Now.""\n\nAll of you start running toward the hanger. ""Keep an eye out for anything,"" Salvucci says. ""It might try to use this plan against us.""\n\nYou reach the hanger in two minutes. You all peek through the threshold to see Markie advancing on a bloodied Strauss, who has her back to the hanger door. The captain's pistol is on the floor several feet from the pair.\n\n""She's wounded,"" Meat says, defeated. ""Infected.""\n\nMarkie is shuffling closer, giggling. Strauss sees the three of you. She looks over at the panel that controls the hanger door and then looks back at you all. She nods.\n\nYou slowly raise your pistol. Markie grabs the doctor by the throat and lifts her into the air. She chokes.\n\nYou feel Meat beside you raising his rifle. His hands are shaking.\n\n1.[[Mercy kill Strauss first.]]\n2.[[Go ahead and shoot the switch.]]\n"
"Comfort him by touching his shoulder.","He stops punching the wall after a while. Blood drips from his fingers. He breathes heavily.\n\n""He’s dead…because of us.""\n\n1.[[""Yeah? Well, let's make it fucking count.""]]\n2.[[""That's bullshit and you know it.""]]\n"
"""I have no idea, guys.""","""Would it kill you to be at least a little dishonest?"" Meat says, smiling. ""Somebody's got to be the optimist.""\n\n""Make your move already, dude,"" says Neil, growing impatient.\n\n""Fine. Zoe, we can talk strategy in a bit.""\n\nYou walk away.\n\n1.[[Talk to Strauss and Salvucci.]]\n2.[[Take a nap.]]"
"""Roger, roger.""","You go your separate ways, hiking down the cliff with Meat. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel.  You step inside and can’t help but feel that you’re entering the dark maw of a living planet.\n\n""Let's get our lights on.""\n\nYou both tell your suits to turn your on your light attachments. Yours flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\nOn the Head Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. You see that yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\nYou proceed through the cave.\n\n""You know what I want,"" Meat says. He doesn't wait for you to answer. ""I want a fucking taco. Beef. Cheese. Some guac on top. No more of this space bag food bullshit.""\n\n1. [[""Hot dogs, dude. Hot dogs.""]]\n"
"""I feel like nobody really wants to go down there, and that no one is going to say otherwise if we leave out some details out of our report. Sound good to everybody else?

"Push Neil out of the way and lunge at Markie.","You push Neil to the side and ram the butt of the pistol into Markie's face. Flesh and pus and blood splash your arm; the revolting stench infilitrates your nostrils. You hit Markie in the face again and again. Her blood's on your face now, in your eyes, in your mouth.\n\nThe body goes limp. You stop. And then, finally having a chance to smell what you're covered in, you vomit.\n\n""Zoe?"" Neil says tapping you on the shoulder.\n\nYou respond by throwing up some more. You're lightheaded and swaying.\n\nNeil says your name again, but you can barely hear it over the screams, a woman screaming inside your head so loud it cracks the walls of you skull and sets your synapses aflame.\n\nIt's Markie. ""Mine,"" she shrieks. ""Mine!""\n\nYou're falling. You succumb to the dark. But in that darkness, she talks to you. Her voice mingling with a deeper one, the voice of the monster. Of the thing that killed her and Ryan and Strauss and Ben.\n\nYou are mine, it says, but you're stronger than those who have come before you. I cannot break your will so easily, so I offer you an opportunity: allow what's happening to you to happen and we can achieve the destiny of my race together. You will be a legend. If you do not, we will find another way. We've slept in the chambers of your planet for your species'entire existence, waiting. The stars are our destiny--not yours.

Do you have your pistol?""\n\nYou nod.\n\n""Good. Hopefully we won’t need it.""\n\nThe two of you walk down the hallway.

"""The fucking thing ripped his head off.""","""Fuck. All right, let’s get her aboard.""\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster. He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. Strauss examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore  while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What the hell is she saying?""]]\n"

He takes your address and promises he'll send an ambulance.\n\nThey come. Your heart shatters when they zip him in a bag.\n\nLater, weeks after the funeral, Meat comes to stay for a couple of weeks. He’s bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg. You watch reruns of sitcoms and play chess. You talk of your loved ones and your children.

"Blast Ben.","You go for your gun, but someone beats you to the trigger. A shot tears off Ben's lower jaw, sending it flying into the wall. The second splits his forehead. The body falls back onto the floor and continues to gurgle.\n\nYou turn to see Strauss holding up the captain's pistol, tears in her eyes.\n\n""Doc,"" Meat says, but she walks past him and continues to fire round after round into the corpse. Ben goes silent and still.\n\n""Lenore,"" Salvucci says, reaching out to comfort her.\n\n""We have to burn him too,"" she says, no hint of emotion in her voice. ""Don't touch him.

Instinct guides you toward the rifle on the floor, but you're thrown to the side before you can even touch it.\n\nYour shoulder slams into the ground and goes numb. Looking up, you see Markie straddling Ben, a scalpel in her hand. She’s giggling. You can only see the side of her face but you know that your friend is gone.

Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you eventually stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Meat running by himself. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You’ve covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you see her fling one of those crab creatures across the ground.\n\n""Damn!"" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces. The two of you rush over to her. She's holding her arm.\n\n""It got me,"" she says; there's fear in her voice. She turns to Meat. ""Where's Ryan?""\n\n""Goddamn fucking thing ate him. It ATE him.""\n\nMeat's answer fills you with cold. Ryan is dead. No one that close to you has ever died before. Your vision becomes unfocused. A slap on the arm brings you back.\n\n""We've got company, Julia. I need you here and now,"" Meat says, nodding at the mouth of the cave where the crab creatures are gathering. There must be thousands of them. Luckily, behind you the Speedwell is landing.\n\nMeat fires several shots at the crabs, but they don't seem to be leaving the cave anyway.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator.

Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit. You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she looks around wildly while Lenore straps her in. \n\nShe examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What’s she saying?""]]\n2.[[""What is that?""]]\n"
"""Everybody cool?""","""Good question. Doctor?"" Salvucci says, turning to Strauss. She's red in the face, clearly panicked.\n\n""I don't know,"" she says. ""There's no way to know we're infected until we start seeing symptoms.""\n\n""Which would be...""\n\n""I don't know, Travis. From our brief encounter with Markie's transformation, I would be inclined to say that we would drop to the floor and start babbling nonsense while our bodies decayed, but she was bitten. If there was an airbone virus when that blob exploded, our transformations could be much more subtle. There's no way to know until whatever happens, happens.""\n\n""A comforting thought,"" Neil says.\n\n""The best thing we can do right now is...just wait. Maybe some of us get some shut eye and then rotate the guard.""\n\n""What are the guards looking out for, exactly?""\n\nStrauss looks at Meat and takes a breath. ""Symptoms. In case something goes wrong with one of the sleepers.""\n\nSalvucci nodded. ""We're all a bit tired. Meat, Zoe, doctor, you three rest first. Neil and I will keep watch.""\n\n""Make sure not to turn into boogeymen,"" Neil says as the three of you head toward the barracks.\n\n""If I do, I'll eat you first, little man,"" Meat replies.\n\n1. [[Sleep in the barracks]]"
"""We’re alive.""","""Yeah, that’s what counts, I guess. What now?""\n\n1.[[""We sleep.""]]\n"
"""We’re screwed, fellas.""","""I was worried you'd say something like that."" Meat sighs. ""Yeah, I guess I should focus some of my mental energy on figuring out how to kill it instead of wasting it on fucking checkers, huh?""\n\n""Make your move already, dude,"" says Neil, growing impatient.\n\n""Fine. Julia, we can talk strategy in a bit.""\n\nYou walk away.\n\n1. [[Talk to Salvucci and Strauss]]\n2. [[Go to sleep.]]\n"

You're warm, in fact.\n\nYou open your eyes.\n\nYou are curled up on the floor of small room with a grey carpet and a fold-out couch.\n\nOn the other side of the room is a young man sitting at his desk, typing away at his computer.

"""Not a thing.""","You snatch the gun from his holster and shoot him in the shin. He falls to the ground screaming in pain.\n\n""The fuck, Julia?!""\n\nYou back away from him, pistol aimed at his head.\n\n1.[[""Don't follow me.""]]\n2. [[Leave without a word.]]"
"Kill him first.","The gunshot echos throughout the hallway. Salvucci slumps against the wall with a bullet in his temple. Smoke drifts upward from the barrel of your pistol.\n\n""God damn it!""

"""Let her go.""","""Are you serious?"" he yells, hands clutching her throat still. She throws a weak punch at his arm. ""She killed him; she’ll kill us, too.""\n\n""Dude, just…stop. We’ll tell the authorities what she did when we get back. She'll rot in prison.""\n\nMeat considers this and then lets go of Strauss. She gasps for air. ""Insane…idiot!""\n\n""You shut your damn mouth. I’m a second away from adding your body to the pile.""\n\nMeat sets down his backpack and opens it up, pulling out the glass bottle, rag, and oil can. He gets to work as Strauss stumbles over to join you and Neil.\n\n""Thanks,"" she says, not turning to face you.\n\n1.[[""Don’t thank me.""]]\n2.[[""I should have let him kill you.""]]\n3.[[""You’re welcome.""]]\n\n\n"
"Murder Meat.","You sniff and then rub your eyes. The tears come quickly.\n\nMeat falls for it. ""Oh hey, hey, Zoe."" He hugs you.\n\nNow, the voice hisses.\n\nYou place your head against his neck. You hear the pumping of an artery. You smell blood. \n\nYou turn and savagely rip into his neck with a sickening bite. Meat's scream becomes a gurgle as you pull away, ripping away the skin and his cartoid.\n\nHe stumbles away fom you, hand pressed agaisnt his neck, but it's no good. He trips over a cable and falls back onto the floor.\n\nHe reaches toward you but then drops his arm. He's dead.\n\nNow, the voice says, the other two.\n\n1. [[Find Neil.]]\n"
"End Ryan's pain.","You take careful aim and fire a single shot that pierces Ryan's visor and kills him instantly. The squad vital monitor shrieks at you as he flatlines.\n\nThe beast roars again and then you catch a glimpse of the monster’s hideous, reptilian face as it darts out and closes its jaws around Ryan’s head. Like fingers plucking a grape from a vine, the beast rips out your squadmate’s head leaving a bloody stump. \n\nYou flee.\n\nLooking over your shoulder, you watch as what’s left of Ryan is pulled out of sight.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but eventually you stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie. Behind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the ground. You run toward your squadmates. You’ve covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell descending.\n\nWhen you reach them, Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fires several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie’s arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your empty pistol and bash the monster’s dome inward. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived, as Meat puts three rounds into the soft underbelly.\n\n""Fucking fuck."" He kicks the crab.\n\nYou turn to Markie, who’s holding her arm. \n\n1.[[""Your suit's ripped.""]]"
"Touch his shoulder.","He stops punching the wall. Blood drips from his fingers. He breathes heavily.\n\n""He’s dead…because of us.""\n\n1.[[""I know. Now let’s make it count.""]]\n2.[[""Nobody could have predicted that.""]]\n"
"Shoot it!","You fire several rounds as well, tearing off her other arm. Still, the body convulses. You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He’s a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body’s back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren’t far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Meat is looking over the bloody hole in Neil’s chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil’s mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I’m so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn’t fast enough…""\n\nHis wound looks deep.\n\nHe turns to you. ""Zo...Zoe, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is…"" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I. Got it?""\n\n1.[[""Shhh. I got it, Neil. Just rest.""]]"
"""You won't find any sympathy with me. Do it yourself.""","""Very well,"" she says. She lifts the scalpel to her neck and pulls it across. She gasps as blood streams down neck. She falls to the floor and chokes.\n\nYou watch until she expires. You leave the room to find the captain and Neil in the hallway examining Meat's corpse.\n\nThey look at you. ""Where's Strauss?"" Salvucci demands.\n\n1.[[""She was infected. She killed Meat out of cowardice.""]]\n2.[[Take no chances: kill both of them.]]"
"""Neil and Markie are dead.""","""Shit. Make your way back to the hall.""\n\nYou do so. Meat and Salvucci are below you, waiting. Meat won't look you in the face.\n\n""Are you sure it's dead?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n1.[[""Yeah, they're not getting back up.""]]\n"
"""Let's get the fuck home, eh?""","""Yeah, let’s.""\n\nThe two of you walk back through the hallway leading to the hanger and then to the cockpit. The bodies of your crew are still there. Meat stares at them.\n\n""Do you think if we had made different choices, they'd still be alive?""\n\n1.[[""We're alive. What else matters?""]]\n2.[[""Meat, I don't know, okay?""]]\n"
"""We check out the vents.""","Salvucci nods. ""That's a viable plan. We'll all enter the ventilation and hunt it down.""\n\n""All of us?"" Neil asks.\n\n""Yes, pilot. All of us.""\n\n""Do I get, like, a weapon at least?""\n\n""Here."" Meat says, shoving his own pistol into Neil's hands.\n\n""Bro, I've never used one of these.""\n\n""Well, if it makes you feel better, it wouldn't help much anyway. Bitch is a bullet sponge.""\n\n""Oh good, you know for a minute there I thought I might actually have decent odds for survival.""\n\n""Quit bickering,"" Salvucci says sternly. ""We'll go for the vent in the central hallway. From there we can spread out and cover the whole ship.""\n\nYou all make your way to the central vent, located in the belly of the ship. Salvucci pushes a button on the wall; the vent shrieks open and down pops a ladder.\n\n""I'll go north. Travis, you're with me. Julia and Neil, you go south. We meet back here in twenty minutes. If you spot it, call for help.""\n\nYou watch as Meat and Salvucci ascend the ladder. You and Neil wait a minute and then go up. \n\nThe shaft is tight, but both of you manage to fit, with you at the front. You crawl slowly, pistol in hand.\n\n""You know,"" Neil says after you've been crawling for five minutes, ""I never thought I'd go out like this. I thought that it'd be from a heart attack...in a bathroom or something, nude on a tile floor, ass up in the air.""\n\n1.[[""Neil. Shut the fuck up.""]]\n2.[[""Oh do tell.""]]"
"""It wiggled a lot.""","""Helpful information,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Great. If it’s not dead, we’re fucked. All we got left is your pistol. I’m guessing you’re down to two clips.""\n\nYou pop the clip out of your pistol to show him it’s the last one.\n\n""Shit.""\n\n""We don’t know if it’s alive. If it is, we’ll improvise.""\n\n""Great, I wonder who’ll die next time thanks to our masterful improvisation skills.""\n\nStrauss says nothing. \n\nA few minutes later you reach the cockpit door. Ben’s body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n\n""Well, that’s good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You notice that Strauss is deliberately looking away from Ben’s smashed skull.\n\nThe three of you step into the cockpit. You slam the door behind you.\n\n""Here’s the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you. You type in ""KONAMI.""\n\nThe screen changes to a selection of menus.\n\n""There’s the autopilot,"" says Strauss. She touches the screen and selects NEW AUSTIN.""\n\n""We done?"" Meat asks.\n\n""Yeah, I think we’re set.""\n\n""Good.""\n\nAll of you approach the door.\n\n""Now let’s get out of here before that fucking thing corn—"" \n\nA tentacle sweeps through the door as soon as it opens and brushes all of you aside with a mighty swing. You all going flying across the room. You slam into the viewport, cracking the glass, and then fall to the floor. Looking up you see the thing step into view: it’s monstrous, with a muscular human abdomen. \n\nThe thing’s face is distinctly unhuman with countless slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster’s mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattlesnake.\n\n""No!"" you hear Strauss scream as one of the tentacles darts out and wraps itself around her neck. It lifts her into the air and pulls her toward its master. You turn to look at Meat who’s paralyzed with fear, watching one of the tentacles dance above him.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1. [[Help Meat.]]\n2. [[Help Strauss.]]\n3. [[Leave them to die.]]"
"""I have faith.""","""Then that makes you an even bigger idiot than I thought you already were.""\n\n""When are they supposed to be back?"" Neil asks before you can reply to Strauss.\n\n""An hour from when we left,"" Strauss says.\n\n""How long ago was that?""\n\n""I don’t know. I’m a doctor, not a timekeeper.""\n\n""Sheesh. Well, okay, so what should we do to pass the time?""\n\n""Time’s going to pass regardless of what we do with it.""\n\n""Right. So you’re going to sulk over there in the corner.

The monster’s mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattle snake.\n\nYou turn to look at Meat.

Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but eventually you stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Meat running by himself. Ryan is nowhere to be seen. You’ve covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you see her fling one of those crab creatures across the ground.\n\n""Fuck!"" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces. The two of you rush over to her.

"""See you on Mars.""","You slide into your chamber and the hatch closes. You quickly fall into slumber. When you wake up, you're surounded by soldiers. One of them, a corporal, is saying something but his words are soundless. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, and Meat are transported to the military outpost in New Austin. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night and it's delicious.\n\nJust as Meat said, men in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, and Salvucci meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in almost complete silence, only uttering the name of the lost from time to time.\n\nYou all take seperate cabs home. When you reach your house in the suburbs, you pass your mailbox but decide to check it later. It's only when you swipe your card against the door's reader and hear it unlock that you feel as though you are truly safe. Inside, you shut the door and hang up your coat.\n\nYou go into the living room and sit on the couch. You do nothing but stare at the wall for hours, in a trance of sorts. You rub you finger up and down one of the cushions of your couch. You are alive to do this, but you're not sure you're thankful for that.\n\nYou begin to see a therapist. You make progress--according to him, anyway. You never really shake the memories of your time aboard the Speedwell, but you're able to cope with them.\n\nThat's more than can be said for Captain Salvucci, who eats a bullet on the third anniversary of your return to Mars. You don't go to the funeral.\n\nYou and Meat stay in contact but the emails you send one another are largely going through the motions bullshit. You never send a word to one another that is true. Your failure to connect with him is indicative of your relationship with the rest of humankind. You never marry or even begin what you're comfortable calling a relationship with anyone. For the first ten years or so, this bothers you but you slowly grow comfortable with this new you.\n\nYou become a writer. Your sci-fi erotica, written under a pseudonym, sells well enough for you to live comfortably by yourself and away from everyone. You're mostly happy, but sometimes there's a thought that strikes at you like a whip: you are completely alone.\n\nThe End"

""I fucking hurt my leg,"" he whimpers.\n\n""A thespian, he is not,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Just let the boy work,"" Meat replies, though it’s clear he’s getting tired of this as well.\n\n""Oh fuck,"" Neil says.\n\n1.[[Answer Neil.]]\n"
"""We draw it out.""","""Okay, with what bait?"" Neil asks.\n\nYou and Meat look at Neil.\n\n""Oh,"" he says, getting it. ""Well fuck that.""\n\n1.[[""Man up already!""]]\n\n"
"""Get a drink.""","""I hear that.""\n\nThe two of you travel by cab to the nearest bar and order your weight in whiskey shots. You laugh as you reminisce about good times with the crew, then you cry as you mourn the tragedy of their deaths. And then comes the silence where you both sit, staring at the table, just drinking as you grapple with the fact that you’re both alive.\n\n""I should get home,"" Meat says. ""Rhonda’s waiting. Give me a call if you need anything, okay?""\n\n1.[[""You too.""]]\n2. [[Nod at him.]]\n"
"Starve.","You can't bring yourself to eat the body of your friend. Instead, you drag his corpse to the bunkroom and close him in so you don't have to look at or smell his corpse.\n\nYou're not far behind him. When it's time for you to go, you climb atop one of the tables and close your eyes. You wake up once, twice, but not the third time. Your sleep is endless.\n\n\nThe End\n"
"Go on home.","""Right. I understand."" She doesn't meet your eyes.\n\nThe cabbie drops you off first at your home in the suburbs.\n""Zoe,"" Strauss says as you get out of the car. ""Take care, okay?""\n\n1.[[""Yeah. You too, doc.""]]\n2.[[Simply nod.]]\n"

""It’s over there. Look.""\n\nThere, lying on the ground, is a black arm with shriveled fingers caked in yellow ooze. You can barely make out three bullet holes.\n\n""Lenore says that Ben saved her life by putting it down,"" Salvucci says.\n\n1.[[""That’s good and all, but what about Markie?""]]\n2.[[""Nice job, Ben.""]]\n"
"Begin","The homeworld is nothing like you thought it would be. The landscape is black as tar and the temperature readings make you thankful for the air conditioning in your suit.\n\nThe crater, the reason for your journey, is dead ahead, a half mile in the distance. You don't mind the trek; this is a far cry from the 35 million miles you and your crew had to traverse for two months.\n\nWhat a long way you’ve come, you muse. But what is an ending but the beginning of another journey, wrote…who wrote that? You wrack your brain for an answer. The answer is just outside the limits of your consciousness, floating. You reach for it, grasp its tail, and then—\n\nSergeant Ryan Benson turns around to look at you.\n\n1.[[""Julia,"" he says.]]\n2.[[""Zoe,"" he says.]]\n\n"

"Join the creatures.","You awaken in sickbay. Meat is standing over you, a relieved expression on his face. You realize your holster's empty; your pistol is gone.\n\nHe's armed. You feel the warmth of your own body. Something's happening inside.\n\n""You okay, Zoe?""\n\n1. [[Murder Meat.]]"
"""Oedipa.""","""While I appreciate your clever literary reference, that is not, in fact, the password.""\n\nStrauss slams the fist of her unwounded arm against the door.\n\n""Listen here, you little shit.

"""What, no foam finger for me, pilot?""","""Ah, she's funny, Meat! I forgot how funny she was!"" he yells. Meat, grinning, shushes him.\n\n""Oh, am I too loud?""\n\nSalvucci soon arrives.

You stumble out of the cab at your house and tell the boys you'll call them later.\n\n""Bionic woman!"" Neil shrieks as the cab takes off.\n\nYour house, it turns out, looks the same as it did before you left on your mission. You take two steps into the living room and fall onto the couch. You grip it with your fingers and, face pressed into the cushions, laugh and laugh and laugh.\n\nYou are home. You are alive and you are home. The military sticks you with an analyst job. Though it's quite boring, there's no danger of getting your head chewed off, so ultimately you're fine with it.\n\nSome years pass. You meet a lovely woman named Michelle at work. She asks you out to dinner. You like each other well enough, so you begin to date. Your relationship is a comfortable one that, though emotionally satisfying, often leaves you yearning for excitement.\n\nYour life is quiet, peaceful. You still meet up with Salvucci, Neil, and Meat from time to time at the bar. They like Michelle.\n\nOne night, Meat takes you aside. ""They're nuking earth.""\n\n1. [[""Say what?""]]"
"""We’ve got to go!""","""Meet us at the center of the crater!"" Markie yells over the comm.\n\nYou look at Ryan’s heart monitor; he’s about to flatline.

"""Don't follow me.""","You hear him call your name as you turn and begin your sprint down the hall.\n\nIdiot, it says. We will win anyway. I offered you evolution, wretch.\n\nBlood drips from your nose. There's a pain in your stomach. You have to hurry.\n\nYou reach the hanger within a minute and seal the door behind you. \n\nYou approach the hanger door and place your hand over the release button. Your legs go numb and you fall to the floor, hand still held against the button. You press it and close your eyes. There's a whoosing sound as air is sucked past you, stinging your cheeks.\n\nThe first thing you feel is the cold. You open your eyes to see the Speedwell in all its glory as you drift away. The thing in your brain screams in anger and despair, but another voice cuts through. ""Just let go,"" Markie says, her voice free of malice and madness.\n\nYou turn away from your ship and peer out across the ocean of [[stars]] to gaze at the sun in the far distance. It's quite pleasant from afar.\n\nYou take her advice.\n\nThe End\n"
"""Are you really going to take her arm off?""","She frowns. ""Protocol states that any possibility of extraterrestrial infection must be removed with prejudice.

"Save Meat.","The hail of bullets clip the tentacle above Meat. It falls to the floor, but the beast itself is unfazed. Meat scrambles over to you.\n\n""We’ve got to go now.""\n\nYou look to Strauss. She’s crying as she’s pulled toward the monster’s face, its mouth stretching to accommodate her head.\n\nYou and Meat run past the monster. As you run, you see Strauss’s face being pressed against all the jagged teeth. You’re turning the corner in the hallway when you hear a sickening snap.\n\n""Keep running! Don’t look back!""\n\nYou both run until Meat, out of breath, stops. You fall to the ground, back against the wall.\n\n""She didn’t deserve to die like that,"" Meat says aloud.

"""Yes, Markie I know what an earthworm is.""","""All right! Just checking. Creatures of the homeworld aren't exactly common knowled--did you hear something?""\n\nYou did. \n\nMarkie slowly pulls out her pistol. ""Just in case.""\n\nSuddenly you hear a high pitched whine from the darkness that sends a shiver down your spine. ""Guys, we're not alone,"" Markie says into her comm.\n\n""What's that?"" you hear Ryan say over your comm.\n\n""There's something in here with us.""\n\nShe nods at you and you both slowly back away. You pull out your pistol.\n\n""What is it?"" Meat asks.\n\n""No idea. Whatever it is, we're in its territory. I'm inclined to think we should leave it alone. Let's head back to the ship.""\n\nThe whine again. You focus your eyes and see something moving in the dark.\n\nMarkie sees it as well. ""Oh god, there's too many of them. Fall back!""\n\nShe fires a single shot. The flash of light reveals that the creature isn't one thing, but many things, with feelers and sharp teeth.\n\nThey rush toward you, hundreds of them.\n\n1.[[Shoot the creatures.]]\n2.[[Retreat with Markie.]]"
"""I’m sorry.""","Neil nods at you one last time. You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nStrauss follows Meat. You look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Strauss and Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. Meat grabs Strauss and pulls her through.You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. Strauss looks on sadly.\n\n1. [[Touch his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Do nothing.]]"
"Approve of Alex.","You and the bride-to-be get along well. She proves to be invaluable emotional support after Jack dies from a stroke.\nShortly after the funeral, Meat comes to visit and stays a couple of weeks.\n\nHe’s bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg.

"""He's dead, Meat.""","""Shit. All right, let’s get her aboard.""\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster. He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly as Lenore straps her in. Strauss examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What the hell is she saying?""]]"
"""I don’t know, you fucking horndog.""","""Right. Sorry. Dumb question,"" he says sheepishly. ""Kind of awkward to put you in that position anyway.

"""Sure, why not?""","""Thanks,"" she says quietly. You get a cab and tell him to take you to the nearest bar. There, the two of you sit in silence for at least an hour, sipping your drinks. Finally, Strauss speaks.\n\n""I killed the captain. I let Ben die.""\n\n1.[[""Yeah. You did.""]]\n2.[[""You're alive, doctor. Isn't that what counts?""]]"
"""What are you going to do when we get back?""","She smiles sadly. ""I don't even care at this point. Maybe retire? I have enough money...I don't know. Just no more space for me.""\n\n""I hear that,"" Meat says as he and Salvucci enter the room. ""No more fucking space EVER.""\n\n""Command is going to decide that, I'm afraid,"" Salvucci says, stepping in front of his pod.\n\n""If command thinks they're getting my ass back on a boat like this, they can go fuck themselves.""\n\n""I'll pass along the message when we get back."" He turns to Strauss. ""Are you okay, doctor?""\n\n""Yes, I'll be fine. Just ready for this to all be over.""\n\n""Well, let's get on our way then.""\n\nYou get in your pod and lie down. ""Sweet dreams everyone,"" you hear Meat say right before your chamber shuts itself. You close eyes. The world gets even darker.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod.\n\nFrom there, you, the captain, Meat, and Strauss are transported to the military outpost in New Texas. You are all given private rooms and access to nearly anything you could want. You order a steak on the first night. It's delicious.\n\nMen in suits come and interview you about your experiences on the Speedwell. You answer their questions in as much detail as you can. They thank you for your time and promise you will be released soon.\n\n""Soon"" turns out to be three days later. You, Meat, Salvucci, and Strauss meet on the base and request a transport to the nearest bar. There, you all drink in merriment, celebrating your survival, though you allow yourselves to mournfully drink a round and say small eulogies for the dead: Ben, Markie, Neil, Ryan.\n\nWhen all of you are finished, you share a cab that drops you off at your respective addresses. You're the first. Your comrades tell you to call them soon just to check in. Inside your small house in the suburbs, you finally allow yourself a good cry. Not for the dead. Not for any reason at all, in particular, except that it's been inside you for so long, struggling to get out.\n\nA week passes. You're relocated to analyst position on the military base in New Austin. You hear that Strauss is working at a military hospital in New Memphis. You never talk to her, really, but Salvucci and Meat send you emails all the time. Both of them have been reassigned to on-base positions; Meat's an instructor, and Salvucci can't tell you what he does. You imagine it has something to do with what you found on earth.\n\nYears pass. You never marry or have children, but you're never alone. Girlfriends come and go, at a rate of about one every five years. You become attached to them all and break down in sobs when each one leaves. You never tell any of your lovers about your experience aboard the Speedwell.\n\nYou and Meat become close. You meet twice a week for lunch. On Wednesdays, you watch sitcoms; on fridays, there's salsa night downtown. You get a dog. \n\nThis is your existence and it proceeds one day after another.\n\nInevitably, you grow old. Salvucci dies first. You and Meat attend his funeral. You and Meat take bets on who's next; turns out it's you.\n\nYou pass away one night in your sleep, your dog curled up behind you with his snout against your back, the poor creature peacefully unaware of your endless slumber.\n\nThe End\n\n\n"
"Shoot the switch.","Meat fires. Strauss' head falls back and her limbs go limp. Markie turns to see all of you. She growls and drops Strauss.\n\nThat's when you fire a single shot at the control panel. Upon impact the door seperating the hanger from the rest of the ship comes down, seperating you from the hanger. Alarms shriek. You watch from the door's window as both Strauss' corpse and the creature are sucked out into space. The two forms drift away until they're dots, inseparable from distant stars.\n\nNone of you give a cheer or breathe a sigh of relief, however. There's a sense of shame that hangs over all of you, an awareness of your cowardice. You played it safe so that one of your crewmates could sacrafice herself.\n\nThe auto-close kicks in and the hanger door shuts itself. The alarms cease their cries.\n\n""We should go check Neil's console,"" Meat says.\n\nThe three of you silently make your way to the cockpit. Inside, you find the autopilot already engaged. The console is covered in blood; the pilot's corpse is behind it.\n\n""He knew he wasn't going to make it,"" Meat says bitterly. ""Setting the autopilot must have been the last thing he did. Another goddamn hero.""\n\n""Everyone who died here will be honored when we get home,"" Salvucci says. \n\n""Oh good, because medals were really what I was concerned about,"" Meat says.
