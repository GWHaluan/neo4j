"""Let’s kill it.""","Meat nods. ""Better than waiting around to die, I suppose.""\n\nSalvucci’s demeanor doesn’t shift. ""If we’re going to do this, we need to have a plan. How many guns do we have?""\n\nYou all lay out your firearms on one of the tables: one assault rifle with two clips, three pistols with 18 rounds each. In total, you have 94 rounds. You also have a Molotov cocktail, courtesy of Meat.\n\n""Is that it?"" says Salvucci.\n\nMeat can’t hide his annoyance. ""What do you mean ‘is that it?’ We have enough here to kill that thing fifty times over. Sorry, captain,"" he adds quickly.\n\nSalvucci doesn’t bother acknowledging the disrespect ""All right, tactics time. Everyone knows the layout of the ship, correct?""\n\n""Two main hallways. Left connects to crew quarters, common room, cafeteria, engineering, cryoroom, and bathrooms. The other leads to sickbay, cockpit, and the hanger,"" Strauss says quickly.\n\n""Pfft. Hanger, if you can call it that,"" Neil says. ""It’s barely big enough to fit our droids.""\n\n""Is that really appropriate right now?"" Strauss says.\n\n""I’m just sayin’.""\n\n""The big question, then, is how we’re dividing teams.""\n\n""I’m with Meat,"" Neil says quickly, eyeing the assault rifle.\n\nStrauss rolls her eyes.\n\n""What? I called dibs.""\n\n""Okay, so that puts Meat and Neil together. Julia, you go with them too. Doctor Strauss and I will take the right hallway.""\n\n1. [[Go with Meat and Neil.]]\n\n\n\n"
"Shoot her down.","You shoot her in the face. Her corpse falls back onto the floor and is still.\n\nMoments later both Neil and Salvucci burst through the door. They see the corpse. Salvucci has his hand in his gun.\n\nNeil speaks first: ""What happened?""\n\n1.[[""She was infected. She killed Meat out of cowardice.""]]\n2. [[Take no chances: kill both of them.]]"
"""I’ve got at least two bullets left.""","""I'm not ready to call it quits yet. There's got to be a way to kill that thing without guns.""\n\n1.[[""Okay, what about the hanger?""]]\n\n"
"Ask her for her name.","""I'll do you one better,"" she says. She writes down her number on the back of an index card and places it on the table next to your bed. ""Give me a call sometime and I'll tell you my name,"" she says, flashing that white smile.\n\nMeat is the one who picks you up from the hospital and drives you home.\n\n""That's pretty badass,"" he says, nodding toward your augmented hand. ""Can you, like, crush steel and shit?""\n\n1. [[""I wish.""]]\n"
"Go for his gun.","He approaches. You reach for his gun, swifter than you thought you could be, and pull it from his holster.\n\n""Julia, what the--"" His cry of surprise is cut off mid-blast as a shot to the chest robs him of his life and knocks him off his feet.\n\nHis dead eyes stare at the ceiling.\n\nNow, the voice says, the other two.\n\n1. [[Search for Neil.]]"
"""You did.""","""I know. It's my weight to bear, I suppose.""\n\nYou sip your drinks without another word until it's time to go. The cabbie takes you home first.\n\n""Julia,"" Strauss says. ""Take care, okay?""\n\n1. [[""Thanks, doc.""]]\n2. [[""I will.""]]"
"""You do as well.""","You watch as Meat staggers out of the bar, hoping he calls a cab. You wait ten more minutes to avoid any awkward post-goodbye goodbyes and then stumble outside yourself.\n\nA cab picks you up and takes you to your little house in the Martian suburbs.  You pay the cabbie and walk past your box—you’ll get the mail later—and inside your home.\n\nThe door slides shut. And that’s when you fall apart. You crumble to the floor and bawl yourself to sleep. You wake up in the night only to cry yourself asleep again.\n\nWhen you wake up again, you want to believe it’s a new day but you can still feel the weight of the dead on your shoulders. It’s a weight you never learn to completely shake, but you grow accustomed to it: the night terrors, the sudden flashes of Ben dying in agony.\n\nMeat’s friendship and an ungodly amount of therapy help you get through the trauma, as does Jack, the man who becomes your husband. The military sticks you with an analyst position, something you’re quite fine with, though it is boring work.\n\nYou grow older. You and Jack talk about having kids.\n\n1. [[You have kids.]]\n2. [[You don't have kids.]]\n"
"""We should wait it out.""","""Ugh. You too?"" Meat groans.\n\n""We're going to regret this,"" Strauss says.\n\nSalvucci shakes his head. ""We'll be fine. Strength in numbers. As long as we stick together, we won't lose anymore people.""\n\nThe four of you decide to stick it out in the mess hall. Meat, you, and Salvucci take turns keeping an eye on the door for Markie. Strauss rations the food that comes out of the pantry...including your chips. You try not to hold it against her.\n\nA week passes. No sight of the creature yet.\n\n""Nice beard you've gotten going on there, Neil,"" Meat tells the pilot, who's been cultivating uneven patches of facial hair.\n\n""Bite me, big man.""\n\nYou're in the middle of biting into the last half of your final soy cookie when you hear the sound in the vent--it's a squishy sound.\n\n""You heard it too,"" Meat says, standing up and pointing his rifle at the vent.\n\nSomething starts to hammer at the vent cover.\n\n""It's her!"" Salvucci yells. ""Fire!""\n\nThe three of you unload your clips into the vent. The destroyed cover falls to the floor. And then something else: A giant, bulbous, leaky sack that explodes when it hits the ground. Blood and pus fly everywhere. \n\nYou black out.\n\nWhen you come to, Meat's helping you up. He, like you and everyone else, is covered in gore.\n\n""Everyone all right?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n""Yeah, ugh this is so nast--"" Meat is interrupted by Strauss leaning over and vomiting on the floor.\n\n""Couldn't have said it better myself, doc. What was that? A bomb?""\n\n""It's...oh god,"" Strauss spits. ""It's what left of her.""  She points at something on the ground.\n\n1. [[Look at what she's pointing at.]]"
"""I'm not crazy about this plan.""","""Everything will be fine,"" Markie says.\n\nThe groups go their separate ways; you hike down the cliff with Meat. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel. You step inside.\n\n""Let's get our lights on.""\n\nYou both tell your suits to turn your on your light attachments. Yours flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head-Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. You see that yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\nYou proceed through the cave.\n\n""You know what I want?"" Meat asks. He doesn't wait for you to answer. ""I want a fucking taco. Beef. Cheese. Some guac on top. No more of this space bag food bullshit.""\n\n1.[[""Pizza.""]]\n2.[[""Space food's not so bad.""]]"
"""Stay safe.""","The door bursts open and flies across the hanger. In steps the monster, mouth stained with blood, eyes looking about wildly.\n\nIt takes a step toward you.\n\n""Over here, motherfucker!"" Meat shouts through his suit’s comm.\n\nIt growls and moves toward Meat. Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall. He grabs onto a wall-railing.\n\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n""Do it, do it now.""\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\n\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he’s behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n""Hold on!""\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they’re pulled back as well.  \n\nA moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster’s fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm. You can’t help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n""We did it,"" Meat says. ""We fucking did it.""\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly. You both laugh.\n\n""We’re alive!""\n\n1.[[""Come on. Let’s get out of the hanger.""]]\n\n"
"Keep on in the direction of the mess hall.","You proceed into the mess hall.\n\n""Check everything,"" Salvucci orders. You check around the tables and near the entertainment closest while Meat looks around the kitchen. Salvucci keeps his eyes on the door.\n\nYou find a bag of chips and pocket it. No monsters, though.\n\nMeat pokes his head out of the kitchen. ""Nothing.""\n\n""Shit,"" Salvucci says. ""I guess we should go to the bu--"" A high-pitched scream cuts him off. Then, gunfire.\n\n""Strauss,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Well, come on, let's go,"" Meat says, running out of the kitchen, rifle in hands.\n\nAll of you run out the door and down the hallway toward Neil's cockpit. You're halfway there when you spot a sticky mass of flesh and blonde hair on the ground.\n\n""It's Ben,"" Meat says.\n\nYou're almost to the body when Strauss, hair a mess and her cheek dripping with blood, steps out from the corner. Her shaky hands are gripped around the captain's pistol, a gun aimed at all three of you.\n\n1.[[""You crazy bitch.""]]"

"Say nothing.","Markie sighs. The four of you trek on in silence until you reach the crater. You approach the edge and look down into the abyss. The area of impact stretches for miles.\n\n""I don’t even see a fucking twig, man,"" Meat says.\n\n""It’s been over a hundred years since the impact. I think all you’re going find is dirt down there,"" Markie replies.\n\n""Don’t forget the radiation,"" Ryan says, kicking a pebble over the edge.\n\n""That too.""\n\nMarkie peers down. ""Zoom,"" she says. You hear the computer inside her helmet respond in affirmation to the command.\n\n""You gonna get that girl of yours a rock from the surface?"" Ryan teases Meat. ""I hear people used to go crazy over moon rocks after the Apollo landings. Might make a punny engagement ring, y’ know? Girls go for that sort of thing.""\n\nMeat grunts. ""Not my woman. She’s endowed, but it ain’t with brains. The humor would, uh, escape her.""\n\n""And the radiation,"" Markie points out.\n\n""Stupid radiation. Ruining everything,"" Ryan says.\n\nHmm. That’s interesting,"" Markie says—it’s almost a whisper.\n\n1.[[""What is it?""]]\n2. [[Remain quiet.]]"
"Help Strauss.","You fire at the tentacle wrapped around Strauss' neck. The appendage snaps and she falls to the floor, gasping for breath. You run by and grab her arm, pulling her to her feet. The two of you sprint past the creature as it focuses its attention on Meat, who cries ""Don't leave me!""\n\nAs the two of you run down the hallway, you can hear his screams echo down the hallway. \n\nYou and Strauss stop when she runs out of breath.\n\n""Why did you save me?"" she asks.\n\n1.[[""Most people would say 'thank you.'""]]"
"""Be careful.""","""Thanks,"" she says. She leaves the mess hall. You hear her break out into a run, her footsteps echoing through the hall.\n\n""Help!"" she shrieks as she runs. ""Help!""\n\nTime passes painfully, slowly. Finally, Salvucci turns to both of you. ""We go. Now.""\n\nAll of you start running toward the hanger. ""Keep an eye out for anything,"" Salvucci says. ""It might try to use this plan against us.""\n\nYou reach the hanger in two minutes. You all peek through the threshold to see Markie advancing on a bloodied Strauss, who has her back to the hanger door. The captain's pistol is on the floor several feet from the pair.\n\n""She's wounded,"" Meat says, defeated. ""Infected.""\n\nMarkie is shuffling closer, giggling. Strauss sees the three of you. She looks over at the panel that controls the hanger door and then looks back at you all. She nods.\n\nYou slowly raise your pistol. Markie grabs the doctor by the throat and lifts her into the air. She chokes.\n\nYou feel Meat beside you raising his rifle. His hands are shaking.\n\n1. [[End Strauss' pain.]]\n2. [[Shoot the switch.]]\n\n\n\n\n"

"""It's straight up bullshit.""","""Man, there's something about that doctor.

Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube.

Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters of Earth—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n""Run into any trouble?""

The thing moans as it hits the floor. It’s surprisingly quick to rise, but Salvucci already has the crowbar in his hand.\n\nHe grunts and brings the curved end down on the back of Ben’s head hard. The thing crumbles and is hit again as it slowly lifts its head. Red and yellow matter splatter the wall—little squirts at first, but they grow larger once the back of the skull caves in and brain matter flies. \n\nSalvucci drops the crowbar after the fifth hit and falls back onto the floor, out of breath.\n\nMeat approaches the beast.

Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. \n\n1. [[Comfort him by touching his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Let him get it out of his system.]]\n"
"Disapprove.","You never make your dislike of your daughter-in-law known, but she can sense it. You never become close.\n\nYou wake up one morning to find your wife cold on the kitchen floor. You get down on the floor and hold her corpse for hours before you finally dial the operator and tell the poor man on the other end that your wife is dead and you have no clue what to do. He takes your address and promises he'll send an ambulance.\n\nThey come. Your heart shatters when they zip her in a bag.\n\nLater, weeks after the funeral, Meat comes to stay for a couple of weeks. He’s bald and uses a cane because of a bum leg. You watch reruns of Friends 2041 and play chess. You talk of your loved ones and your children. Then, unexpectedly, he brings it up: ""Do you ever think of them? The crew?""\n\n1.[[""Yes.""]]\n2.[[""Never.""]]\n3.[[""What’s the use?""]]\n"
"Play Rock, Paper, Scissors.","You go four rounds. Neil wins two of them (rock over scissors each time). You with the other two times, with paper over rock.\n\nYou’re about to start the fifth round when the second door to sickbay opens, and Meat and Salvucci step inside; both men were dark expressions.\n\n""I’m guessing your hunt was uneventful?"" Strauss says.\n\n""Yeah, go on and rub it in then,"" Meat says, turning to rifle through the medical cabinets.\n\n""What are you looking for?""\n\n""Food.""\n\n""This is a medical facility, you fool. What makes you think there’s food in here?""\n\nMeat opens one of the lower cabinets and, after a moment, pulls out a large bag of apricot chips.\n\n""Your assistant told me about his stash a while back.""\n\n""I’m glad you can eat his food while his remains are in the same room as you.""\n\n""Not like he’s going to need them,"" Meat says with a shrug.\n\n""Enough you two,"" Salvucci barks.

"Burn that motherfucker.","""I'm a fan of anything that doesn't include the possibility of us getting sucked out into space.""\n\n""We just might catch the whole ship on fire is all,""  Salvucci says.\n\n""Not if we do it right.

Just...just trust me, okay?""\n\nSalvucci nods. ""Okay, doctor. What do we need to do?""\n\n""Give me your gun. I'm gonna run ahead and try and get it to follow.""\n\n""That's insane!"" Meat yelled.\n\n""It'll track me. You guys follow behind at a distance and when you get there, you do exactly as I say, okay?""\n\nSalvucci hands her his pistol. ""Stay safe,"" he says.\n\nShe nods.

"Go eat.","The mess hall is rather small: two tables next to an enclosed kitchen. You find Meat sitting by himself, shoveling ramen into his mouth. A plastic cup filled with cheap whiskey is next to his arm. You grab your favorite snack, a box of soy oatmeal cookies, from the paltry pantry and take a seat.\n\nMeat looks up at you, eyes red, a weary expression.\n\n""Hell of a day, huh? Poor Ryan. How's Markie?""\n\n1.[[""Strauss is removing her arm.""]]\n2.[[""Not great.""]]\n\n"
"""Thanks, doc.""","When you get inside your house, you finally allow yourself to break down and cry. For the dead, for you, for Strauss.\n\nIt takes years for you to come to terms with the fact that you're alive. You see a therapist to help you cope with the nightmares and PTSD episodes. You are reassigned to a boring job as an analyst, an occupation you're fine with. You never marry, though you do have a series of healthy relationships with their ups and downs.\n\nTwenty years later, Strauss sends you an email out of the blue; ""I'm sorry"" is all it says. The next morning the local news reports the suicide of a renowneddoctor. You turn off the TV before the anchor says her name. Though you never really talked after the Speedwell incident, you can't help but feel that your universe is a little smaller without Dr. Lenore Strauss in it.\n\nYou are now alone.\n\nThe End"

"""Ben’s dead.""","Strauss closes her eyes and momentarily bites her lip. ""I’m a coward.""\n\nSalvucci holsters his gun. ""There’s nothing you could have done, doctor. Let’s go.""\n\nStrauss looks up, her remorse stowed away or perhaps an illusion. ""What about the creature?""\n\n""Meat’s burning the bodies.""\n\nHer eyes widen. ""Why the everliving hell is that lumbering mountain of idiocy doing such a thing?""\n\n""He thinks they might come back.""\n\n""That fucking idiot! We don’t know how that infection works. It could be twice as deadly as an airborne virus. I need those bodies intact. Call him! Stop him!""\n\nSalvucci's face goes pale. ""I don’t have a walkie.""\n\n""Run,"" she says.\n\nAnd you do. As fast as you can. Inside sickbay you find Meat, sitting down on the floor, staring at where the bodies should be, but instead there’s only a lot of blood and some meaty chunks.\n\nAn oil can, a bottle, and a rag are next to Meat.\n""Where are they?""  Strauss demands. ""The bodies? Where are they?""\n\n""Oh good. You’re alive,"" Meat says. You can feel the force of his eyeroll from here.\n\n""Where are the bodies? Did you burn them?""\n\n""No, doctor. As you would have gathered from the lack of smoke if you weren’t a nutjob, I have not burned a damn thing. I came back and they were gone.""\n\nStrauss approaches Meat, gets in his face. ""Well did they just fucking get up and walk off?""\n\nHe yells back. ""I don’t know!""\n\n""Everyone relax,"" Salvucci says, voice raised.  Meat and Strauss calm down, both refusing to look at the other, both saying nothing.\n\n""We’ve got two missing bodies, possibly infected and mutated into hostile lifeforms."" Salvucci rubs his forehead. ""I need thoughts, suggestions, anything. Where should we go from here?""  He turns to you first. \n\n1.[[""We should check on Neil.""]]\n2.[[""Let’s go hunting.""]]\n"
"Go ahead and shoot the switch.","Meat fires. Strauss' head falls back and her limbs go limp. Markie turns to see all of you. She growls and drops Strauss.\n\nThat's when you fire a single shot at the control panel. Upon impact, the door seperating the hanger from the rest of the ship comes down, dividing you from the hanger. Alarms blare. You watch through the door's window as both Strauss' corpse and the creature are sucked out into space. The two forms drift away until they're dots, inseparable from distant stars.\n\nNone of you give a cheer or breathe a sigh of relief, however. There's a sense of shame that hangs over all of you, an awareness of your cowardice. You played it safe so that one of your crewmates could sacrafice herself.\n\nThe auto-close kicks in and the hanger door shuts itself. The alarms cease their cries.\n\n""We should go check Neil's console,"" Meat says.\n\nThe three of you silently make your way to the cockpit. Inside, you find the autopilot already engaged. The console is covered in blood; the pilot's headless corpse is behind it.\n\n""He knew he wasn't going to make it,"" Meat says bitterly. ""Setting the autopilot must have been the last thing he did. Another goddamn hero.""\n\n""Everyone who died here will be honored when we get home,"" Salvucci says. \n\n""Oh good, because medals were really what I was concerned about,"" Meat says.

"""You sick bastard.""","Meat turns away without a word. He leaves through the other sickbay door.\n\nYou step outside to find Salvucci loading his pistol.\n\n""Better to be safe than sorry. Do you have your pistol?""\n\nYou nod.\n\n""Good. Hopefully we won’t need it.""\n\nThe two of you walk down the hallway. Salvucci appears to be deep in thought.\n\n1.[[""It ain't your fault.""]]\n2.[[""Why the long face, cap?""]]\n\n"
"""Everyone okay?""","""Good question. Doctor?"" Salvucci says, turning to Strauss. \n\nShe's red in the face, clearly panicked.\n\n""There's no way to know we're infected until we start seeing symptoms.""\n\n""Which would be...""\n\n""I don't know, Travis. From our brief experience with Markie's transformation, I would be inclined to say that we would drop to the floor and start babbling nonsense while our bodies decayed...but she was bitten. If there was an airbone virus when that blob exploded, our transformations could be much more subtle. There's no way to know until whatever happens, happens.""\n\n""A comforting thought,"" Neil says.\n\n""The best thing we can do right now is just wait. Maybe some of us get some shut eye and then rotate the guard.""\n\n""What are the guards looking out for, exactly?""\n\nStrauss looks at Meat and takes a breath. ""Symptoms. In case something goes wrong with one of the sleepers.""\n\nSalvucci nods. ""We're all a bit tired. Meat, Julia, doctor, you three rest first. Neil and I will keep watch.""\n\n""Make sure not to turn into boogeymen,"" Neil says as the three of you head toward the barracks.\n\n""If I do, I'll eat you first, little man,"" Meat answers.\n\n1. [[Sleep in the barracks.]]"
"Go ready for the cryopods for the two of you.","You head to the cryogenics room and boot up two pods. On the terminal, in the bottom left corner of the screen, a window of text catches your eye.\n\n1.[[Read the text on the screen.]]\n2.[[Finish programming the pods.]]"
"Dart into the kitchen.","You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He’s a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body’s back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren’t far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Meat is looking over the bloody hole in Neil’s chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil’s mouth. You hear another stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I’m so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn’t fast enough…""\n\nHis wound looks deep.\n\nHe turns to you. ""Zo...Zoe, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is…"" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I.

"""It's covering its own noises.""","""Well, we’re about to put an end to that shit,"" Meat says as you approach the crew’s quarters. You see large cables running through the doorway; they lead up the wall and into the ceiling.\n\nNeil reaches up and runs his hand along the cables. He quickly pulls it back. ""Augh! Fuck!""\n\n""What is it?"" Meat barks.\n\n""Nothing,"" Neil says, regaining his composure. ""Just fucking slime. Oh god, gag a maggot,"" he says. ""This shit reeks."" He holds his hand up to the light to reveal a goopy, transparent liquid.\n\n""Hey, that looks a little bit like—""\n\n""Don’t you say it, Travis.""\n\nYou examine the cables without touching them.\n\nMeat takes a look as well. ""Seems like a complicated operation.""\n\n""What, turning on the computer, starting a program, and plugging in some cables?""\n\nMeat turns.

"""What the hell is she saying?""","""Complete gibbersh, sounds like,"" Lenore says with cold detachment. ""Move."" \n\nShe scoots past you and turns on the device in her hand. A hot laser point darts out about three inches from the top port of the device. Another line escapes the bottom port and swings around to connect to the top line.\n\n""Cauterizing saw,"" she explains. ""You might want to leave this to the professionals, girlie. It’s going to get a little messy.""\n\n1.[[""You're not really going to take her arm off, are you?""]]\n2.[[""The fuck is wrong with you?""]]\n3. [[Say nothing. Leave.]]"

"""I really don't know.""","""Guess it isn't much use wondering about it, huh?"" He turns away from them, though you notice his eyes lingering on Strauss' corpse for a moment.\n\n""God, I just want some sleep.""\n\n1.[[""Let's sleep then.""]]\n"
"""I'm ready to go hunting.""","""I like the sound of that!"" Meat says, slapping your back.\n\n""Hunt it with what, precisely? You shot it in the head, right?"" Strauss says.\n\n""Yeah.""\n\n""It got back up, right?""\n\n""Yeah, but this time I'll make it stay dead.""\n\n""With fire? You ignorant ape, what if those bodies are toxic? What if we inhale a virus?""\n\n""Doc, it's not that fucking hard. We set them on fire and then close the door.

"Go for the gun.","You dive and grasp the rifle. It’s in your hands when you see Markie twisting the knife in Ben’s skull; the boy convulses.\n\nYou aim down the sights, but the captain beats you to it, his pistol planted against her temple. He fires. Brain, skull bits, and strands of hair blast across the light and onto the floor. The thing that was Markie topples over to the ground, blood spewing out of the nose and mouth as it giggles.\n\nThe red eyes roll around in her head like in a slot machine before settling on you.\n\n""Buy two hypostims, get three free. Just come on down to the Couponia at Rylock’s junction this Saturday—""\n\nSalvucci puts another bullet in its face. Markie jerks and then stops moving completely.\n\nMeat bends down to examine Ben. ""He’s dead,"" he says. The boy’s face is a sea of blood and torn flesh. Half his eyeball has been pushed up through the socket.\n\nA moment passes. Meat raises his gun and puts a round through Ben’s head. You leap back in surprise.\n\n1.[[""What the hell was that for?""]]\n2. [[Give Meat a chance to explain.]]\n"

Meat scrambles over to you.\n\n""We’ve got to go now.""\n\nYou and Meat run past the monster. It swings a tentacle at you that comes close to taking off both your heads.

"Continue toward the mess hall.","""See?"" Meat says. ""Juila says he'll be fine too. He's a big boy.""\n\n""Idiot,"" Strauss says.\n\nThe four of you make your way to the mess hall. \n\n""Check everything,"" Salvucci orders. You check around the tables and near the entertainment closest while Meat looks around the kitchen. Salvucci keeps his eyes on the door. Strauss sits at a table away from everyone.\n\nYou find some soy raisin cookies and pocket them. No monsters, though.\n\nMeat pokes his head out of the kitchen. ""Nothing."" He looks at all of you and shrugs his shoulders. ""What now?""\n\nAs if to answer him, a loud shriek erupts from the vent hanging over you all.\n\n""A GIFFTTTTT,"" Markie screams from the vent.\n\n""Oh god,"" Strauss says, backing into the wall.\n\n""Kill it,"" Salvucci says, raising his pistol. You, Meat, and Salvucci fire into the vent.\n\n""Don't waste your ammo. Just a few shots,"" Meat yells.\n\nYou fire half of your clip and lower your weapon. The vent cover drops to the floor. Meat and Salvucci lower their guns as well.\n\n""We got her, right?"" Meat says.\n\n""agiftagiftagiftagift,"" Markie answers from the vent.\n\n""Fuck me.""\n\n""agiftagiftagiftAGIFTAGIFTAGIFT,"" she screams. At first, you're not sure what falls from the vent. You just see a small, almost circular object dropping through the air. When it hits the ground with a splat, you know what it is, but you can't bring yourself to look.\n\nStrauss' screams confirm your fears. You finally look down; it's Neil's head. Both his eyes have been gouged out and there's a jagged line of flesh and muscle where he was decapitated.\n\n""A GIFT!"" Markie yells once more before you hear her scamper away further into the ducts.\n\n""I told you,"" Strauss, the first to speak, says. ""We should have sent someone to look after him.\n\nMeat kicks over a table.\n\n""I told you!"" Strauss screams at him.\n\n""Doctor, quiet,"" Salvucci barks. He lowers his voice. ""We'll mourn later.""\n\n""If we fucking live that long,"" Meat says.\n\n""We have to trap it,"" Strauss says suddenly. ""I think it's pretty clear bullets aren't effective. We need to either space her or trap her in a tightly contained space and set that bitch on fire.""\n\n""Risky options,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""For once, I'm in agreement with the good doctor.

If it is, we’ll improvise.""\n\n""Great, I wonder who’ll die next time thanks to our masterful improvisation abilities.""\n\nStrauss says nothing. \n\nA few minutes later you reach the cockpit door. Ben’s body is still there, as are the burnt remains of the captain.\n\n""Well, that’s good, all things considered,"" says Meat. You notice that Strauss is deliberately looking away from Ben’s smashed skull.\n\nThe three of you step into the cockpit. You slam the door behind you.\n\n""Here’s the computer.""\n\nYou step over to the main console. A password screen greets you. You type in ""KONAMI.""\n\nThe screen changes to a selection of menus.\n\n""There’s the autopilot,"" says Strauss. She touches the screen and selects NEW AUSTIN.\n\n""We done?"" Meat asks.\n\n""Yeah, I think we’re set.""\n\n""Good.""\n\nAll of you approach the door.\n\n""Now let’s get out of here before that fucking thing corn—"" \n\nA tentacle sweeps through the door as soon as it opens and brushes all of you aside with a mighty swing.

Looking up, you see the thing step into view: it’s monstrous, with a greekly perfect human abdomen. \n\nThe monster's face is distinctly unhuman with countless, slitted eyes glaring at you. The monster’s mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattlesnake.\n\n""No!"" you hear Strauss scream as one of the tentacles darts out and wraps itself around her neck.  It lifts her into the air and pulls her toward its master. You turn to look at Meat who’s paralyzed with fear, watching one of the tentacles dance above him.\n\nYou reach for your pistol.\n\n1.

"Punch her.","""I didn't have--"" the impact from your fist sends her to the floor.\n\nShe starts to get back up, but Meat yanks her off her feet and slams her into the wall.\n\n""Fuck!"" she screams, blood across her lower lip.

Meat shouts in her face.\n\n""Travis…stop,"" Neil says.\n\n""No, she’d kill us all if it worked to her advantage, Neil.

"Shoot Strauss first.","You put a bullet in Strauss' leg. She falls to the ground screaming ""No!""\n\nThe beast advances.\n\nShe turns, reaching toward you with an outstretched hand. ""I don't want to die!""\n\nYou unload the rest of your clip into the viewport and press the button on the wall. The door comes down, separating you from Strauss and the monster. Through the window you watch the beast lift its massive foot above Strauss' head and then brings it down, snapping her neck.\n\nThe viewport finally shatters, sucking both the beast and Strauss' corpse into space. An alarm blares for a couple of seconds before the emergency panel closes over the viewport.\n\nYou breathe a sigh of relief. You're alive. You won.\n\nYour body aches, but you have one last thing to do before you can enter the cryochamber. You don't know how to make a molotov cocktail, so you go around the ship in search of bodies. When you find them, if they have a skull, you stomp it in.\n\nAfter you're done, you go to the cryoroom and ready one of the pods.It hisses as the hatch slides open. You get inside and close your eyes.\n\nYou're ready for this nightmare to be over.\n\nWhen you awaken, you find yourself being assisted by a corporal. He takes you by the arm and guides you up from the pod. \n\nYou're transported to a private room on the biggest military outpost in New Austin. You order steak and wine but find that you don't have an appetite. Some suits interview you.

"Kill Markie.","""Here’s what we’re going to do,"" Salvucci starts. \n\nThe sudden discharge of your pistol cuts him off. The first two rounds shatter the quarantine glass. You approach the cube. \n\nSomeone—-Meat perhaps?-—is shouting something, but it’s too late. You're raising your gun, leveling it at Markie’s head. She looks up at you, uncomprehending.\n\nYou fire once.  A mixture of red and yellow liquid spills out of the back of her head as her body crumples. The smell is excruciating. You gag. And that’s when Meat smashes the butt of his rifle into your face.\n\nYou black out.\n\nYou wake up two months later in a cell where Salvucci, with a mixture of sympathy and disgust hiding behind his blue eyes, explains how they put you in cryo sleep for the rest of the journey home and how, now, you will be brought before a military tribunal for the murder of your fellow crewmember.\n\nHe refuses to listen when you try to explain your actions and offers you only one comfort before leaving: he hears your lawyer is pretty damn good.\n\nAnd she is. She manages to convince the court that you committed, not murder, but manslaughter out of concern for your crew. You serve five years at Titan penitentiary. After beating the living piss out of the first person who tries to intimidate you, no one messes with you for the rest of your sentence.\n\nUpon release, you became a jack of all trades, mostly those related to physical labor. The years pass. You work as a plumber,a construction worker, a repairwoman for Mal's Repair. The last one turns out to be the job you keep for most of your life. It's not what you dreamed of being, but it pays rent, groceries, and then some.\n\nEventually you get lonely and give Meat a call, hoping to reconcile. He’s not there. You leave a message, but he never calls back. You have night terrors and imagine Markie’s face, her yellow eyes, staring at you from beyond the darkness. \n\nWhen you were younger, you told yourself you’d never be a cat lady, so you become an alpaca lady instead. Most of your free time and extra money are dedicated to purchasing cute clothes for your robo-alpaca. You call her CiCi. You have lovely, one-sided conversations.\n\nFinally, some fifty years after you killed Markie, you begin to feel life slip away from you. You’re not sure if it’s disease or depression or some form of universal comeuppance, but you let yourself go piece by piece. You’re defiant all the way to the end. ""I did the right thing,"" you mutter to yourself. ""I saved lives."" \n\nSoon you fall into eternal rest. You leave Cici to your younger sister, but she never comes for her.\n\n                          The End\n"
"""Yeah, they're not getting back up.""","""Either way, we'll burn the corpses. Travis, take care of it.""\n\n""On it,"" Meat says, leaving you two alone.\n\n""Come on, we'll head to the cockpit. See if we can figure out how to fly this thing.""\n\nIf only it were that easy. You and Salvucci discover Neil's console locked.\n\n""Did he ever tell you his password?""\n\n1. [[""No, he didn't.""]]\n"
"""Fucking thing ate him.""","""Fuck. All right, let’s get her aboard.""\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience for tomfoolery, awaits you—his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster.\nHe takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat. ""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit.  You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite; it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore; she's prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What’s she saying?""]]\n2.[[""What is that?""]]\n\n"
"Shoot.","You fire several rounds as well, tearing off her other arm. Still, the body convulses. You watch as Neil turns to run to the kitchen. He’s a foot away from the door when a grey tentacle shoots out of the body’s back and impales him through the chest. It whirls him about and throws him through the kitchen door.\n\n""Fuck it, run! Run!"" Meat yells. He drops the rifle and runs into the kitchen. You aren’t far behind, jumping over a low slash from the tentacle. Right before you step inside, you see another writhing tentacle erupt from her body.\n\nYou slam the door and turn around. Strauss and Meat are looking over the bloody hole in Neil’s chest. Blood is dripping from the corner of Neil’s mouth. You hear a stretching sound follow by a splash outside. Another tentacle.\n\n""Fuck me, fuck fuck fuck,"" Meat says, his voice dripping with guilt. ""I’m so sorry.""\n\nNeil looks up at him. ""Not your fault, big man. Wasn’t fast enough…""\n\n""Stop talking, sweetie,"" Strauss says, taking you by surprise with the earnest care in her voice as she examines the wound. ""An artery’s been pierced.""\n\n""Shit, is there anything you can do for him?""\n\nStrauss looks at you both, clearly not wanting to give her answer in front of Neil. You feel a tap on your arm. Neil looks up at you.\n\n""Julia…Julia, come here.""\n\nYou lean down.\n\n""Cockpit. Computer login is…"" he coughs up some blood. ""login is ‘K-O-N-A-M-I.' Got it?""\n\n1.[[""Yeah, I got it.""]]\n\n"
"""Will do, partner.""","""Did I hear some eagerness there?"" He said, smiling wearily. ""Come on. \n\nLet’s get this over with."" His smile disappears as you both hear footsteps—giant footsteps.\n\nYou retreat to the hanger.\n\n""Shit,"" he says as the door slides shut behind you. ""I thought this thing was bigger.""\n\nHe’s right: it’s not much, and half the room is cramped by the reconnaissance droids.\n\n""Loosen the holding clamps on those. I’ll get our suits. Hurry, it can’t be far behind us.""\n\nYou deactivate the locks on the droids and catch the suit that Meat throws you. You’re just about to put the helmet on when you hear the clanging on the door.\n\n""Shit. It’s here. When it gets in front of the droids, shoot the hanger switch, okay? And for fuck’s sake, hold on to something.""\n\n1.\t[[""Stay safe.""]]\n"
"Don't eat him.","You can't bring yourself to eat the body of your friend. Instead, you drag his corpse to the bunkroom and close him in so you don't have to look at or smell his corpse.\n\nYou're not far behind him. When it's time for you to go, you climb atop one of the tables and close your eyes. You wake up once, twice, but not the third time. Your sleep is endless.\n\nThe End\n\n"
"""I’m with Markie.""","""Awesome, someone I can actually depend on,"" she says, shooting a dirty look at Ryan.\n\n""The hell did I do?""\n\nShe ignores his question. ""You two will take that hole over there.""\n\n""All right then,"" Meat says.\n\n1.[[""This is a bad idea.""]]\n2.[[""Let's go.""]]"
"""Do it yourself.""","""Very well,"" she says. She lifts the scalpel upward and pulls it across her throat. She gasps as blood streams down her neck. She falls to the floor and chokes.\n\nYou watch until she expires. You leave the room to find the captain and Neil in the barracks examining Meat's corpse.\n\nThey look at you. ""Where's Strauss?"" Salvucci demands. His gun is in his hand.\n\n1.[[""She was infected; she killed Meat and then killed herself.""]]\n2. [[Shoot the both of them.]]"
"""She had killed the captain. Karma.""","Your confession damns you. You're court-martialed and found guilty of murder in the first degree. You're sentenced to life aboard Titan penitentiary. For you, life turns out to be three years.\n\nWhen you refuse the courtship of one of the most powerful inmates in the penitentiary, she has one of her thugs stab you in your throat while you're taking a shower.\n\nAs the blood and suds and water swish all around you on the way to the drain, you look up at your nude attacker. On her calf, you see a tattoo of an angel and a demon dancing around a single word: ""Karma.""\n\nYou almost want to laugh. Almost.\n\nThe End"
"""What the hell was that for?""","""He might come back, y’know?"" Meat says. ""Like a zombie.""\n\n""Stop talking,"" Salvucci says. ""We need to find Strauss.""\n\n""If she isn’t dead,"" Meat says grimly, eyes set on what’s left of Ben’s face.\n\n1.\t[[""He said Markie chased her into the hall.""]]\n2.\t[[""Ben said Markie chased her into the hallway. She’s probably dead.""]]\n"
"""Cthulhu?""","""What’s that? Oh, you’re making a joke, aren’t you? Hardly the time, Julia."" He says, giving you a sharp look of disapproval. He sighs.\n\n""Maybe Strauss will know what it is—if she’s still alive.""\n\n1.\t[[""Don’t talk like that.""]]\n2.\t[[""You’re right. She’s probably dead.""]]\n"
"""Don't be a pussy.""","""Easy for you to say, Julia. You’re not the one who’s being served up as dinner.""\n\nMeat slaps Neil on the shoulder. ""We won’t let you get eaten, okay?""\n\n""You’re not making this any more appealing.""\n\nHe takes a breath. ""Okay, well, how are we going to do this?""\n\n""We’ll go to the cafeteria—big, open space.""\n\nYou all make your way to the cafeteria, eyes watching the walls and vents. The journey is a safe one. \n\nAll of you step into the cafeteria.\n\nNeil looks out across the tables like a man looking at his own grave.\n\n""I always thought lunchrooms were kind of scary when I was a kids, ‘cause of the bullies and all. Never thought I’d die in one, though.""\n\n""You’ll be fine,"" Meat says. ""We’ll be in the other room. You’re gonna stay in here and use your walkie.""\n\n""To do what?""\n\n""Be bait. Make helpless noises.""\n\n""How’s it gonna hear that?""\n\n""Marki—what used to be Markie has a walkie clipped to her belt.""\n\n""And if she thinks it’s a trap?""\n\n""She won't."" Meat says as you and he make your way to the kitchen door.\n\n""I can’t believe this shit,"" Neil says.\n\nYou and Meat step into the kitchen and move away from the door. He turns to you. ""Make sure you have your gun ready, okay? I don’t want Neil to get eaten because we ran dry.""\n\nYou check your pistol to make sure it has a full clip and nod. You both listen to Neil in the other room. ""Please help me,"" you hear him beg. ""I can’t find you guys.""\n\nThis goes on for 20 whole minutes, Neil’s acting growing steadily worse. ""I fucking hurt my leg,"" he whimpers.\n\n""He's clearly never taken a drama class,"" Meat says.\n\n""Oh fuck,"" Neil says urgently.\n\n1. [[Hand Meat the walkie.]]\n\n"
"""Yeah. You did.""","""I know. It's my weight to bear, I suppose.""\n\nYou sip your drinks without another word until it's time to go. The cabbie takes you home first.\n\n""Zoe,"" Strauss says. ""Take care, okay?""\n\n1.[[""Yeah. You too, doc.""]]\n2. [[Simply nod.]]\n"
""" Doctor Strauss is right; stop dicking around, Neil.""","""Right, well, can one of you humorless assholes bring me up to speed at least?""\n\n1.[[""Ben’s dead now.""]]\n2.[[""There are one, possibly two monsters crawling around the ship.""]]\n"
"Sleep in the barracks","In the barracks, Meat flips on the lights and the three of you find your respective beds.\n\n""Sleep tight, ladies,"" says Meat.\n\nTo your surprise, you find yourself drifting to sleep atop your bunk. Dreamless sleep covers your eyes. Briefly.\n\nYou awaken to the sound of choking. The first thing you see through blurred vision is a blood trail on the floor. You leap out of the bed and follow the trail out of the room to find Meat on the ground, neck slit. His eyes are watery as he grasps his throat.\n\n""Strauss,"" he says. ""Strauss."" He nods toward the common room.\n\nHe closes his eyes and is gone forever.\n\nYou proceed to the common room. You open the door to find Strauss standing in the middle of the room, a bloody scalpel in her hand. Her back is to you.\n\n""Zoe?"" she says, not turning to face you.\n\n1.[[""What the hell did you do?""]]\n"
"""One word: ‘hanger.’","""Space. You want to jettison the fucker. That’s insane. He’s slow though, so maybe it could work.""\n\n1.\t[[""What else are we going to do?""]]\n\n\n\n"
"""Where did you look?""","""Everywhere,"" Meat says before swallowing a chip. \n\n""Engineering, the cafeteria, the cryo room. We checked every nook and cranny. My guess is they’re in the vents.""\n\n""This is some fucked up shit,"" Neil says.\n\n""Eloquent as always, pilot,"" Strauss snaps.\n\n""We should move shop,"" Meat says after a moment. ""This facility has two doors. I don’t like that. Captain and I were talking; the common room is more safe and it’s closer to the cafeteria. We can make supply runs.""\n\n""…while we, what? Wait for the creature to die?"" Strauss asks.\n\n""That’s the plan. We stay safe, let it starve.""\n\n""And what if it can wait longer than us? What if that’s part of the thing’s plan, eh? Wait till we get sick and hungry enough for it to overpower us? Did you even bother thinking about the logistics of that move? Cryosleep is part of the ship’s travel. We don’t have enough food on board to support us until we reach Mars. We have maybe a month at the most before we run out. Then what?""\n\n""I don’t know, okay? I hear a lot of criticism but I don’t hear you contributing anything else, doctor.""\n\nStrauss scowled. ""That’s because I’m trying to prevent you from leading us into a disaster.""\n\n""Can it, the both of you,"" Salvucci commands. ""Meat’s right as far as safety precautions go. The common room will be easier to fortify and protect than this place. We can worry about long term plans once we get set up there. Doc, you and Neil grab whatever supplies you think we might need from in here. Travis, you and Julia make a trip to the cafeteria, bag some grub, meet us in the common room. Be. Careful.""\n\n""Yeah, boss. Got it,"" Meat says. ""Come on, Julia.""\n\nThe two of you leave as Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci retrieve medical supplies.\t\n\n""You and the captain should have put a round in her when you found her,"" Meat says as you walk toward the cafeteria.\n\n1.[[""Not funny.""]]\n2.[[""Your bickering is going to get us killed.""]]\n3.[[""It was tempting.""]]\n\n"
"""Yeah, I do.""","""Well, good for you then,"" she says in a bitter tone.\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit. You knock on the door.\nNeil’s muffled voice comes from beyond the door: ""Password?""\n\n1.[[""Open the door, numbnuts.""]]\n2.[[""Oedipa.""]]"
"Kill Meat.","You place your head against his neck. You hear the pumping of an artery. You smell blood. \n\nYou turn and savagely rip into his neck with a sickening bite. Meat's scream becomes a gurgle as you pull away, ripping away the skin and his cartoid.\n\nHe stumbles away you hand pressed agaisnt his neck, but it's no good. He trips over a cable and falls back onto the floor.\n\nHe reaches toward you but then drops his arm. He's dead.\n\nNow, the voice says, the other two.\n\n1. [[Search for Neil.]]\n"
"""It was you or her.""","""Yes,"" he says, wiping his forehand with the back of his hand. ""Yes, it was. Thanks.""\n\nYou both take a breath.\n\n""What now?""\n\n1.[[""Kill or be killed.""]]\n2.[[""I’ve got at least two bullets left.""]]\n\n\n\n"
"Absentmindedly kick rocks while you wait for someone to answer.","""Ryan, let Captain Salvucci know what we’ve found. Let’s try and get a pick up at the LZ in two hours.""\n\n""Aye.""\n\n""That thing loaded, Meat?""\n\n""Duh.""\n\n""Okay, I’m thinking we should split up to cover more ground. How should we do this?""\n\n1.[[""I’m with Ryan.""]]\n2.[[""I’m with Markie.""]]\n3.[[""I’m with Meat.""]]\n"
"Attack with the saw.","You grab the saw. Markie's about to leap atop you when you swing the heated blade into her right foot, removing it from the rest of her body. She topples back as the leg stump turns into a geyesr of black blood. You throw the saw at her face, blinding her with heat.\n\n""Put her in the chamber!"" Strauss roars, pointing with her free hand at the cryochamber in the corner of the room. Meat and the captain are quick, grabbing the creature by its arm while it flails about. They pull it by the rotting arm to the chamber quickly. The pod hisses as it opens. Markie snaps at them, tries to attack with her claw but she can't get a shot in. She shrieks as Meat and Salvucci heave her into the pod.\n\nYou smash the pod's panel with your fist and the chamber closes. You can hear Markie's muffeled screams from within. \n\nShe starts to smack the door with her claw; cracks appear in the glass.\n\n""Whatever you're doing do it fast, doc."" Meat says, aiming his rifle at the pod.\n\n""Put your gun down and take this,"" she says, passing off the hose from the machine. Meat takes it. ""Now, plug it into the port at the bottom of the pod. Hurry! And make sure it's plugged in tight.""\n\nAnother crack in the glass. Meat takes the hose and screws it into the pod's hole.\n\n""Let go!""\n\nMeat backs away from the hose. Strauss presses several buttons on the machine.\n\n""What is that?"" Salvucci says.\n\n""It's the incinerator,"" she says, slamming her palm down on one last button. You hear the roar of the flames as they pass through the hose and into the chamber itself. The inside of the pod lights up as Markie's screams become even louder. \n\nMarkie beats against the glass harder with her claw, but it's useless. Within minutes, the creature's been vaporized.\n\nFor a moment, no one says anything. And then, just as you're all about to take a breath, in stumbles what was once Ben. The monster, missing both its eyeballs, gurgles as it reaches toward you with rotting hands.\n\n1.[[Blast Ben.]]\n"
"""What the shit, Travis?""","""He might come back, y’know?"" Meat says. ""Like a zombie.""\n\n""Stop talking,"" Salvucci says. ""We need to find Strauss.""\n\n""If she isn’t dead,"" Meat says grimly, eyes set on what’s left of Ben’s face.\n\n1.[[""Ben said she was chased into the hallway.""]]"
"""Hey! Focus. I need you here. We can stew in our guilt later, got that?""","He stops punching the wall after a while. Blood drips from his fingers.\n\n""He’s dead because of us.""\n\n1.[[""Yeah, well, let's make sure he died for something worth dying for.""]]\n2.[[""Get your head in the fucking game.""]]"
"""Please be quiet.""","""Right. Sorry, Julia.""\n\n""Andattheboardwalkifound..."" A shiver runs up your spine.\n\n""Uh...what was that?""\n\nYou raise your pistol up in front of you. You see nothing.\n\n""Was that Mar--HOLY SHIT!""\n\nYou feel Neil scramble up your leg. You turn to see Markie, her face slowly melting on Neil's pants leg.\n\n""Oh shit oh shit oh shit.""\n\nNeil's head is in the way. You can't get a clear shot.\n\n1. [[Take the shot anyway.]]\n2. [[Lunge at Markie.]]\n"
"Take out your weapon","You unholster your pistol. You hear it again: scuttling, and then something else--a high pitched whine that sends a shiver down your spine.\n\n""We're not alone,"" Meat says, voice low.\n\n""What's that?"" you hear Ryan say over your comm.\n\n""There's something in here with us. We're turning back.""\n\nMeat nods at you and you both slowly back away.\n\n""What do you see, Meat?"" Markie asks.\n\n""Dunno. Don't like it whatever it is."" \n\nThe whine again. You focus your eyes and see something moving in the dark.\n\nMeat sees it, too. He fires at it. As muzzle flash fills the cave with brief spells of light you see that the creature isn't one thing, but many things, with feelers and sharp teeth.\n\nThey rush toward you, hundreds of them.\n\n""Let's get out of here!"" Meat yells.\n\n1.[[Shoot them.]]\n2.[[Run away.]]"
"""This is a bad idea.""","""Everything will be fine,"" Markie says.\n\nThe groups go their separate ways; you hike down the cliff with Markie. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel. You step inside.\n\n""Let's turn our lights on,"" Markie says quietly.\n\nYou both tell your suits to turn your on your light attachments. Yours flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head-Up Display (HUD) of your suit, you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. You see that yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\nYou proceed through the cave.\n\n""These caverns are massive. This one seems to just go on and on.""\n\n1.[[""What do you think made them?""]]\n"
"""Travis...let her go.""","""Are you serious?!"" he yells, hands clutching her throat still. She throws a weak punch at his arm. ""She killed him; she’ll kill us, too.""\n\n""Dude, just…stop. We’ll tell the authorities what she did when we get back.""\n\nMeat considers this and then lets go of Strauss. She gasps for air. ""Insane…idiot!""\n\n""You shut your damn mouth. I’m a second away from adding your body to the pile.""\n\nMeat sets down his backpack and opens it up, pulling out the glass bottle, rag, and oil can.  He gets to work as Strauss stumbles over to join you and Neil.\n\n""Thanks,"" she says, not turning to face you.\n\n1.[[""Don't you say a goddamn word to me.""]]\n2.[[""I really should have let him kill you.""]]\n3.[[""Yeah.

""It'd be a shame for you to get your face bitten off.""\n\n""Here. Take this."" Salvucci hands her his pistol. She nearly drops it.\n\n""Thanks captain.""\n\n""Be careful.""\n\nWithout another word, she disappears around the corner.\n\n1. [[Keep on in the direction of the mess hall.]]"
"Hand Meat the walkie.","Meat takes the walkie. ""Neil?""\n\n""She’s fucking here, guys. Oh god she reeks.""\n\n""Sit tight,"" Meat says. He nods at you. Both of you creep to the door. Meat pushes it open slightly and peers out. You look out as well.\n\nNeil is backing into a wall, face red and dripping with sweat. Several feet away is Markie. You can smell her from here, but that’s not what’s making you struggle not to gag. Her face is a jagged piece of flesh hanging from her skull, her sockets void of eyeballs.\n\n""Stay away from me,"" Neil begs.\n\nIt lumbers toward the pilot, groaning. Several teeth fall to the ground in a mixture of salvia and blood.\n\n""Now,"" Meat says.\n\nThe two of you emerge from the kitchen. Markie doesn’t even have time to turn her head before machinegun fire rips the neck from her body and her head tumbles to the floor, smashing to the ground like a pumpkin.\n\nMeat opens his mouth to let loose a witty remark, but vomit emerges. You’re not far behind, the smell finally having gotten the best of you. Luckily, there’s not much for you and your partner to barf up.\n\n""Oh godfuckingshit,"" Neil yells. ""That was Markie."" He takes a step closer to the body, his arm over his nose. ""So, we like win now, right? They’re all dead?""\n\n""Yeah, I think—""\n\nMeat is cut off by the sound of Markie’s hand slapping the floor as the body convulses, pus and blood shooting from the decimated neck stump. He fires the rest of the clip into the corpse.\n\n1. [[Shoot her!]]\n2. [[Run into the kitchen!]]\n"
"Save Meat's life.","The hail of bullets clip the tentacle above Meat. It falls to the floor, but the beast itself is unfazed. Meat scrambles over to you.\n\n""We’ve got to go now.""\n\nYou and Meat run past the monster. It swings a tentacle at you that comes close to taking off both your heads. The monster howls as you rush past it. \n\nYou both run until Meat, out of breath, stops in a distant hallway. You fall to the ground, back against the wall.\nYou both take a breath.\n\n""What happens now?""\n\n1.[[""We put that thing down. Once and for all.""]]\n2.[[""Well...I've got two bullets.

"""Any ideas how to beat that thing?""","""One, but we have to act quickly. Let's go to sickbay.""\n\nYou follow her. When you get there, she tells you to lock both doors leading into the unit.

She ejects each bullet from the clip and then sticks her brush carefully inside the flask. Pulling the brush from the flask, she coats each bullet with some of the goo.\n\n1.[[""What are you doing?""]]\n"
