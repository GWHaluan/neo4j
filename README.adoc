About the project
-----------------

I drew inspiration from link:https://neo4j.com/blog/vampire-express-graph-database-choose-your-own-adventure/[Vampire Express: Graphing a Classic â€™80s Choose Your Own Adventure Story] by Joe Depeau, one of the suggestions included in _Technical Writing challenge 1.4 - Google Docs.pdf_.

I first discovered _Choose Your Own Adventures_ when I was a teenager.
At the time I had a physical copy, a booklet that related thematically to a tabletop role-playing game.
It had me look up pages to proceed with the story and I really liked the unique way of interacting with the text, rather than just consuming the content.

Graph-based models of _Choose Your Own Adventures_ are well explored.
For example, some interesting aspects of such graph representations are covered in link:https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cyoa-choose-your-own-adventure-maps[These Maps Reveal the Hidden Structures of 'Choose Your Own Adventure' Books] by Sarah Laskow.

Unfortunately, I no longer had the booklet from 20 years ago (and I think it was in German language) nor any other _Choose Your Own Adventure_ books at the ready.
Instead, I went online and looked for a suitable digital model.

The data model
--------------

Getting hold of usable source data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I always loved link:https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_q_alien[Alien], so that was my go-to search term alongside _Choose Your Own Advenutre_.

I found the article link:https://www.polygon.com/2014/9/8/6123049/alien-aliens-avp-terror-aboard-the-speedwell[The best Alien game is a text adventure] by Danielle Riendeau which highly praised the adventure _Terror Aboard the Speedwell_.
An entirely free and playable version can be found link:https://jgwaltneiv.itch.io/the-terror-aboard-the-speedwell[here].

.To download the game:
. Click +Download+.
. In the overlay, click +No thanks, just take me to the downloads+ above the donation input.
. For the HTML-based version, +Download+ _The Terror Aboard The Speedwell 1.2.zip_.

Luckily, the HTML-based version contained the entire adventure as a set of +div+-elements.

Extracting the data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I used Python to parse the HTML and to convert the data to CSV.
Then I used Neo4j's CSV upload to populate my project with both node and edge data from the HTML file.

See the link:divparser.py[Python script] for reference.

Populating the Neo4j graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GWHaluan/neo4j/main/nodes.csv" AS row MERGE (c:Storynode {id: row.incoming, text: row.text});
----


[source]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GWHaluan/neo4j/main/edges.csv" AS row MATCH (e:Storynode {id: row.from})
MATCH (c:Storynode {id: row.to}) MERGE (e)-[rel1:CONNECTS_TO]->(c) ON CREATE SET rel1.choice = row.to;
----


[source]
----
MATCH ()-[r:CONNECTS_TO]->()
DELETE r
----

[source]

MATCH (n:Storynode)
DELETE n
