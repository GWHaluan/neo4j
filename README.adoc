About the project
-----------------

I drew inspiration from link:https://neo4j.com/blog/vampire-express-graph-database-choose-your-own-adventure/[Vampire Express: Graphing a Classic ’80s Choose Your Own Adventure Story] by Joe Depeau, one of the suggestions included in _Technical Writing challenge 1.4 - Google Docs.pdf_.

I first discovered _Choose Your Own Adventures_ when I was a teenager.
At the time I had a physical copy, a booklet that related thematically to a tabletop role-playing game.
It had me look up pages to proceed with the story and I really liked the unique way of interacting with the text, rather than just consuming the content.

Graph-based models of _Choose Your Own Adventures_ are well explored.
For example, some interesting aspects of such graph representations are covered in link:https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/cyoa-choose-your-own-adventure-maps[These Maps Reveal the Hidden Structures of 'Choose Your Own Adventure' Books] by Sarah Laskow.

Unfortunately, I no longer had the booklet from 20 years ago (and I think it was in German language) nor any other _Choose Your Own Adventure_ books at the ready.
Instead, I went online and looked for a suitable digital model.

The data model
--------------

Getting hold of usable source data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I always loved link:https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_q_alien[Alien], so that was my go-to search term alongside _Choose Your Own Advenutre_.

I found the article link:https://www.polygon.com/2014/9/8/6123049/alien-aliens-avp-terror-aboard-the-speedwell[The best Alien game is a text adventure] by Danielle Riendeau which highly praises the adventure _The Terror Aboard the Speedwell_, written by Javy Gwaltney.
A free and playable version can be found link:https://jgwaltneiv.itch.io/the-terror-aboard-the-speedwell[here].

.To download the game:
. Click *Download*.
. In the overlay, click *No thanks, just take me to the downloads* above the donation input.
. For the HTML-based version, *Download* _The Terror Aboard The Speedwell 1.2.zip_ and unzip it.

Luckily, the HTML-based version contains the entire adventure as a set of +div+-elements which are sufficiently readable and more importantly easy to process.

Extracting the data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The +div+-elements with the story snippets inside _The Terror Aboard The Speedwell 1.2.html_ look like this:

The homeworld is nothing like you thought it would be. The landscape is black as tar and the temperature readings make you thankful for the air conditioning in your suit.

The crater, the reason for your journey, is dead ahead, a half mile in the distance. You don't mind the trek; this is a far cry from the 35 million miles you and your crew had to traverse for two months.

What a long way you’ve come, you muse. But what is an ending but the beginning of another journey, wrote…who wrote that? You wrack your brain for an answer. The answer is just outside the limits of your consciousness, floating. You reach for it, grasp its tail, and then—

Sergeant Ryan Benson turns around to look at you.

I used Python to parse the HTML and to convert the data to CSV.
Then I used Neo4j's CSV upload to populate my project with both node and edge data from the HTML file.

See the link:divparser.py[Python script] for reference.

Populating the Neo4j graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GWHaluan/neo4j/main/nodes.csv" AS row MERGE (c:Storynode {id: row.incoming, text: row.text});
----


[source]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GWHaluan/neo4j/main/edges.csv" AS row MATCH (e:Storynode {id: row.from})
MATCH (c:Storynode {id: row.to}) MERGE (e)-[rel1:CONNECTS_TO]->(c) ON CREATE SET rel1.choice = row.to;
----


[source]
----
MATCH ()-[r:CONNECTS_TO]->()
DELETE r
----

[source]

MATCH (n:Storynode)
DELETE n
