Download +The Terror Aboard The Speedwell 1.2.zip+.
Luckily, the file +The Terror Aboard The Speedwell 1.2.html+ contains a list of +div+-elements with all text snippets for the story.

I used Python to parse the HTML and to convert the data to CSV.
Then I used Neo4j's CSV upload to populate my project with both node and edge data from the HTML file.

See the link:divparser.py[Python script] for reference.
