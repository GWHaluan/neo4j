"StoryTitle","The Terror Aboard The Speedwell"
"""She was infected.""","The man seems doubtful of your lie, but he has no evidence to contradict it.\n\nWithin three days, you're free to leave the military base. \n\nYou return to your home in the suburbs and pour yourself a drink from the unopened bottle of whiskey in your cabinet. In spite of recent events, you feel...good. \n\nNot only did you survive horrific setup ripped from a bad horror movie...you killed someone and got away it. You feel a buzz.\n\nYou got away with murder.\n\nAnd thus begins your reign as Mars' most renowned serial killer. Drunks staggering away from the bar and the homeless are your victims. Your weapon of choice? A scalpel. Each kill fills you with a kind of energy you've never known. The news says you're doing it because you're religious or you play video games or you have sexual fantasies about your mother.\n\nYou have no delusions. You just like killing people. \n\nThe cops finally get you on the sixteenth murder. Turns out the poor bum you stabbed was undercover. You see the flash of red and blue as soon as you penetrate the poor officer's throat. You run, not even bothering to retrieve the scalpel jutting from his trachea.\n\nYou don't get very far. The sniper's bullet shatters your sternum, sending bone fragments into your heart. You're already dying when you hit the ground.\n\nAs police officers gather to get a good look at you, all you can do is wonder what they'll say about you on the morning news.\n\nThe End\n"
"Say nothing and leave.","You hear him call your name as you turn and sprint down the hall.\n\nFool, it says. I offered you evolution, wretch.\n\nBlood drips from your nose. There's a pain in your stomach. You have to hurry.\n\nYou reach the hanger within a minute and seal the door behind you. \n\nYou approach the hanger door and place your hand over the release button. Your legs go numb and you fall to the floor, hand still held against the button. You press it and close your eyes. There's a whoosing sound as air is sucked past you, stinging your cheeks.\n\nThe first thing you feel is the cold. You open your eyes to see the Speedwell in all its glory as you drift away. The thing in your brain screams in anger and despair, but another voice cuts through. ""Just let go,"" Markie says, her voice free of malice and madness.\n\nYou turn away from your ship and peer out across the ocean of stars to gaze at what you think is the sun in the far distance. It's quite pleasant from afar.\n\nYou take her advice.\n\nThe End\n\n"
"""It's pretty funny, you saying that, when you were ready to pull her down a couple of hours ago. Just sayin'""","You see hurt flash across Strauss' eyes.\n\n""Zoe,"" Salvucci says sharply.\n\n""No, it's okay,"" Strauss says. ""They were friends, except your friend's dead, Zoe. That thing out there isn't Markie anymore. I just hope you realize that and don't get us killed,"" she says turning away from you.\n\nThe two of them descend into uncomfortable silence; Strauss looking at her feet, Salvucci at the viewport. You feel awkward standing there, so you wander away.\n\n1.[[Take a nap.]]"
"""Suck it up, Neil. Cry later.""","He doesn't seem to hear your harsh comment. ""Fuck. Guys, I have to tell his parents.""\n\n""Worry about that later,"" says Salvucci. ""Right now we need to—""\n\nThe alarm wails through the halls. Salvucci turns to Meat. What’s left of the color in Meat’s face drains as he gazes at the control panel.\n\n""Contamination in sickbay. Quarantine square’s been broken.""\n\n""What’s going on?""\n\nSalvucci is quick. ""Neil, you stay here. We’ll lock you in so you’re protected. You two come with me. Arm yourselves.""\n\nMeat grabs his rifle, and the three of you are out of the cockpit. Right before the metallic door slides shut, you hear Neil say ""protected from what?""\n\n1. [[Head to sickbay.]]"
"Refrain from doing anything.","""Fuck. Guys, I have to tell his parents.""\n\n""Worry about that later,"" says Salvucci. ""Right now we need to—""\n\nThe alarm wails through the halls. Salvucci turns to Meat. What’s left of the color in Meat’s face drains as he gazes at the control panel.\n\n""Contamination in sickbay. Quarantine square’s been broken.""\n\n""What’s going on?""\n\nSalvucci is quick. ""Neil, you stay here. We’ll lock you in so you’re protected. You two come with me. Arm yourselves.""\n\nMeat grabs his rifle, and the three of you are out of the cockpit. Right before the door slides shut, you hear Neil say ""protected from what?""\n\n1. [[Go to sickbay.]]"
"""We did our best.""","He sighs. ""I want to believe you, but...nevermind. What now?""\n\n1.[[""We sleep.""]]"
"""It ain't your fault.""","""They're all dead because of me,"" he says quietly. ""I've never had people die under my command before. It's a strange feeling.""\n\n1.[[""Ben isn't on you.""]]\n2.[[""Let it go. I need you here and focused. We all do.""]]"
"Let ‘em burn.","You follow Salvucci as he leaves the room. Before you step out you turn to Meat. His face is pale.\n\n1.[[""Good luck.""]]\n2.[[""Be careful.""]]\n3.[[""You sick fuck.""]]\n"
"Run. Now.","You fire several shots into the sea of creatures and even kill a few, but they still surge toward you.\n\n""What are you doing? Run!""\n\nYou both retreat. ""Neil,"" Meat yells over the comm. ""Bring the Speedwell to the LZ. We need some fucking help here.""\n\n""Coming as fast I can,"" you hear Neil say.\n\nYou run and run and run. You surge ahead of Markie and lose feeling in your legs, but somehow you keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but eventually you stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you see Meat running. Ryan is nowhere to be found. You’ve covered half the distance to Meat when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nYou're almost to him when you hear Markie scream. Turning, you watch her fling one of the crab creatures across the ground.\n\n""Fuck!"" she yells.\n\nMeat blasts the creature into pieces.The two of you rush over to her. She's holding her arm.\n\n""It got me,"" she says; you detect fear in her voice. She turns to Meat.\n\n""Where's Ryan?""\n\n""Goddamn fucking thing ate him. It ATE him.""\n\nMeat's answer fills you with dread. No one that close to you has ever died before. Your vision becomes unfocused. A slap on the arm brings you back.\n\n""We've got company, Zoe. I need you here and now,"" Meat says, nodding at the mouth of the cave where the crab creatures are gathering. There must be thousands of them. Luckily, behind you, you hear the Speedwell land.\n\nMeat fires several shots at the crabs, but they don't seem to be leaving the cave anyway.\n\nYou and Meat help Markie to the ship’s elevator. Meat enters a combination on the keypad and the door slides open. Inside the elevator, as you ride up, all three of you remove your helmets. You notice for the first time that your face is drenched in sweat.\n\nA ding. The door opens. Captain Jonas Salvucci, an older, muscular man with little patience of tomfoolery, awaits you—-his hand wrapped around the pistol in his holster. He takes his hand away from the gun when he sees there’s no threat.\n\n""Get her to sickbay.""\n\nYou nod and help Markie through the hallway of the ship. Behind you, you can hear Salvucci interrogating Meat.\n\n""What happened to Ryan?""\n\n""He's dead, cap. Something got him.""\n\n""Hell, Travis. What did you find down there?""\n\nWhen you get to sickbay, both Lenore Strauss, the doctor, and her geeky assistant Ben are prepping the examination table.\n\n""Where’s she wounded?"" Lenore asks, as you help a woozy Markie out of her suit. You glare at Ben as he gawks at her well-toned body. He smiles sheepishly and looks away, cheeks burning red with shame. Markie’s drenched in sweat; she stares around wildly while Lenore straps her in. She examines the bite: it’s just above the elbow, an inflamed bulging of the skin.\n\n""And I was young and we were running,"" Markie rambles, ""eyes bouncing up and down the shore while the sun cooked the corpses of washed up jellyfish.""\n\nYou turn to Lenore, who’s prepping some kind of tool.\n\n1.[[""What the hell is she saying?""]]"
"""I'm fine. Stop asking.""","He looks away sheepishly. ""Sorry.""\n\n""Stop trying to hit that, Ryan. It’s not gonna happen,"" says Markie, the Speedwell's science officer.\n\nRyan waves his hands dismissively. The enforcer of the group, Meat, chuckles. ""She told you.""\n\n1. [[Wink at Markie in appreciation.]]"
"""Move past it or more people are going to die.""","He nods. ""You're right. Need to focus on the task at hand. What do you think it is you found on earth?""  \n\n1.[[""Cthulhu?""]]\n2.[[""No clue.""]]\n"
"Eat him.","You take your knife and slowly cut up Meat's body. It's messy work, dividing the flesh and muscle from the bone. You store the body in various bags that are then stuffed into the freezer.\n\nYou stay alive another week, but the ships never come. The will to live finally leaves you; you lay down on the floor and close your eyes. You would cry if you had the strength.\n\nThe last thing you feel is the cold of the metal floor leaving your cheek.\n\nThe End\n\n"
"""It was tempting.""","""Right? She's awful. No doubt about it.""\n\nThe two of you enter the cafeteria and then, after taking a precautionary look around, you go into the kitchen and begin to stuff everything you can get your hands on into the two bags you brought from sickbay: fruit chips, soda, water bottles, pastries, canned soup.\n\nWhen you’ve filled the bags, you leave the cafeteria and make your way to the common room. Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n""Run into any trouble?"" Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n""Didn’t see a damn thing,"" Meat says.\n\n""I’m telling you,"" Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, ""we won’t see it until it wants us to see it.""\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n""How’s your arm, doctor?"" Salvucci asks.\n\n""Fine, captain. Thank you.""\n\nYou feel tired.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\n1. [[Talk to Meat and Neil]]\n2. [[Go to sleep.]]\n"
"""Nothing to be done about it, I guess.""","He shrugs his shoulders. ""I guess so.""\n\nYou both return to your group of friends to find that Neil is mooning the barkeep.\n\nWeeks pass. One day you see a report about Earth destructing. ""An issue with the core,"" says the handsome anchor. No one mentions monsters. No mentions nukes or fleets of war crusiers. It stirkes you that no one will ever know the sacrifices of you or your crew. You weep and Jessica asks what's wrong.\n\nYou lie. Just as you do when she asks you about the augmentations--the very ones she installed. ""Accident in the cryotube,"" you tell her. You're so wracked with guilt over these lies that you make it a priority to never lie to her about anything. For the most part, your relationship is one built on trust.\n\nThree years after your return to Mars you're married. It's a simple ceremony. Your parents show up, as do the surviving members of your crew. You eat cake. You kiss.\n\nYou move in with Jessica even though her apartment is smaller than yours. You just love the view of the Martian landscape and Jessica, quite content not to move anything, is more than happy to oblige you.\n\nOne day you catch a glimpse of light reflecting off the glass window of the balcony. You step onto the balcony and look out across the red canyons of your planet just to take in the beauty of it all. This is your new life, you tell youself. You've earned every second of it.\n             \nThe End\n\n"
"""I'm so sorry, Neil.""","You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nYou look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. \n\n1. [[Put your hand on his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Don't.]]"
"""It doesn't at all.""","""Right?  What a horrible thing to do.""\n\nYou both return to your group of friends to find that Neil is mooning the barkeep.\n\nWeeks pass. One day you see a report about Earth mysteriously self-destructing .""An issue with the core,""  says the handsome anchor. No one mentions monsters. No mentions of nukes or fleets of war crusiers. It stirkes you that no one will ever know the sacrifices of you or your crew. You weep and Michelle asks what's wrong.\n\nYou lie. Just as you do when she asks you about the augmentations. Accident in the cryotube, you tell her. You're so wracked with guilt over these lies that you make it a priority to never lie to her about anything else. For the most part, your relationship is one built on trust.\n\nThree years after your return to Mars you're married. It's a simple ceremony. Your parents show up, as do the surviving members of your crew. You eat cake. You kiss.\n\nMichelle moves in with you. You live a comfortable life together. She starts talking about children and you make efforts to put off that conversation for as long as possible.\n\nOne day, the two of you take a trip to the recently terraformed beach. There's a moment where you're looking out across the manufactured ocean of Mars, wondering what lies ahead for you.\n\nYou know the ocean is fake, but you can't help but admire its beauty. This is your new life, you tell youself. It's one you've made for yourself, and you've earned every second of it.\n             \nThe End\n\n"
"""We should check on Neil.""","Salvucci nods. ""That’s a good idea.  You take doctor Strauss and do that. Travis and I will go check engineering. If it's wounded and looking for some place to hide, there’s plenty of spots. Let’s meet back here in an hour.""\n\nStrauss scoffs. ""You’re treating the beast like it’s a wounded animal. You’re wrong. It showed no hesitation when it attacked. It’s not afraid of us. It’s waiting.""\n\nSalvucci wrinkles his nose as he is wont to do when someone said something that annoyed him. ""Regardless, we’ll find the creature and put it down.""\n\n""Creatures,"" she says, correcting him. ""There might be two of them now.""\n\n""Noted,"" Meat says, replacing the clip in his rifle.  You realize now that he has the most powerful firearm on the ship.\n\n""If you two run into it or them or whatever, don’t try to fight. Just run. Come find us.""\n\n""We should stop talking and get on our way,"" Strauss says gruffly. ""Before it eats that damnable pilot, which wouldn’t be such a bad thing if we didn’t need him to fly the ship.""\n\n""Now’s not the time for jokes, doctor,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Who says I was joking?"" Strauss replies before leaving the room. \n\nYou follow.\n\n""Julia,"" Meat calls right before you step into the hallway. You turn. ""Be careful.""\n\nStrauss is waiting for you when you step outside. She’s holding her arm. There’s a patch of red coming through the white sleeve right above the elbow.\n\n""It’s not a bite,"" she says, noticing your stare. ""I fell when I was running and my arm took the fall.""\n\n1.\t[[""Don’t strain yourself then.""]]\n2.\t[[""I guess that means you’re useless in a fight.""]]\n\n"
"""You left him to die, you bitch.""","She glares at you and her lip quivers. You think she's holding back tears. ""You don't think I know that?"" \n\nFor a moment you think she's going to lunge at you.\n\n""Doctor, calm down!"" Salvucci says, grabbing her arm. ""And you,"" he says, looking dead at you. ""What the fuck's gotten into you?""\n\nStrauss looks up, her face void of emotion. ""Forget it. What about the creature?""\n\n""Meat’s burning the bodies.""\n\n""Why the everliving hell is that lumbering mountain of idiocy doing such a thing?""\n\n""He thinks they might come back.""\n\n""That fucking idiot! We don’t know how that infection works. It could be twice as deadly as an airborne virus. I need those bodies intact. Call him! Stop him!""\n\nSalvucci's face goes pale. ""I don’t have a walkie.""\n\n""Run,"" she says.\n\nAnd you do. As fast as you can. Inside sickbay, you find Meat, sitting down on the floor, staring at where the bodies should be, but instead there’s only a lot of blood and some meaty chunks.\n\nAn oil can, a bottle, and a rag are next to him.\n\n""Where are they?""  Strauss demands. ""The bodies? Where are they?""\n\n""Oh good. You’re alive,"" Meat says. You can feel the force of his eyeroll from here.\n\n""Where are the bodies? Did you burn them?""\n\n""No, doctor. As you would have gathered from the lack of smoke if you weren’t a nutjob, I have not burned a damn thing. I came back and they were gone.""\n\nStrauss approaches Meat, gets in his face. ""Well did they just fucking get up and walk off?""\n\nHe yells back. ""I don’t know! You’re supposed to be the doctor here.""\n\n""Everyone relax,"" Salvucci says, voice raised.  Meat and Strauss calm down, each refusing to look at the other, each saying nothing.\n\n""We’ve got two missing bodies, possibly infected and mutated into hostile lifeforms."" Salvucci rubs his forehead. ""I need thoughts, suggestions, anything. Where should we go from here?""  He turns to you first. \n\n1.[[""We should check on Neil.""]]\n2.[[""Let’s go hunting.""]]"
"""No.""","""So you’re just as lonely and pathetic as I am. Well, misery, company and all that, I suppose.""\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit. You knock on the door.\nNeil’s muffled voice comes from beyond the door: ""Password?""\n\n1.\t[[""Uhh…""]]\n2.\t[[""42.""]]\n3.\t[[""Open the damn door.""]]\n"
"""Regardless, don’t let this distract you. I need you here, not in mourning. Save that for later.""","He sighs. ""You're right. Need to focus on the task at hand. What do you think it is you found on earth?""  \n\n1.[[""Cthulhu?""]]\n2.[[""No clue.""]]\n"
"""Probably to put us on edge.""","""Well, we’re about to put an end to that shit,"" Meat says as you approach the crew’s quarters. You see large cables running through the doorway; they lead up the wall and into the ceiling.\n\nNeil reaches up and runs his hand along the cables. He quickly pulls it back. ""Augh! Fuck!""\n\n""What is it?"" Meat barks.\n\n""Nothing,"" Neil says, regaining his composure. ""Just fucking slime. Oh god, gag a maggot,"" he says. ""This shit reeks."" He holds his hand up to the light to reveal a goopy, transparent liquid.\n\n""Hey, that looks a little bit like—""\n\n""Don’t you fucking say it, Travis.""\n\nYou examine the cables without touching them.\n\nMeat takes a look as well. ""Seems like a complicated operation.""\n\n""What, turning on the computer, starting a program, and plugging in some cables?""\n\nMeat turns. ""You didn’t see how feral this thing was—not to mention she’s missing a goddamn arm.""\n\n1.[[""It might be Ben.""]]\n"
"Use the saw.","You reach and grab the saw. Markie's about to leap atop you when you swing the heated blades into her right foot, removing it from the rest of her body. She topples back as the leg stump turns into a geyesr of black blood. You throw the saw at her face, blinding her with heat.\n\n""Put her in the chamber!"" Strauss roars, pointing with her free hand at the cryochamber in the corner of the room. Meat and the captain are quick, grabbing the creature while it flails about. They pull it by the rotting arm to the chamber quickly. The pod hisses as it opens. Markie snaps at them, tries to attack with her claw but she can't get a shot in. She shrieks as Meat and Salvucci heave her into the pod.\n\nYou smash the control panel with your fist and the chamber closes. You can hear Markie's muffeled screams from within. She starts to smack the door with her claw; cracks appear in the glass.\n\n""Whatever you're doing do it fast, doc."" Meat says, aiming his rifle at the pod.\n\n""Put your gun down and take this,"" she says, passing off the hose from the machine. Meat takes it. ""Now, plug it into the port at the bottom of the pod. Hurry! And make sure it's plugged in tight.""\n\nAnother crack in the glass. Meat takes the hose and screws it into the pod's port.\n\n""Let go!""\n\nMeat backs away from the metal hose. Strauss presses several buttons on the machine.\n\n""What is that?"" Salvucci says.\n\n""It's the incinerator,"" she says, slamming her palm down on one last button. You hear the roar of the flames as they pass through the hose and into the chamber itself.The inside of the pod lights up as Markie's screams become even louder. \n\nIt beats against the glass harder with her claw, but it's useless. Within minutes the monster's been vaporized.\n\nFor a moment, no one says anything. And then, just as you're all about to take a breath, in stumbles what was once Ben. The creature, missing both its eyeballs, gurgles as it reaches out toward you with rotting hands.\n\n1. [[Shoot Ben.]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
"Give him a comfort pat and offer your condolences.","""Thanks,"" he says, turning his attention to the viewport. ""I have to tell his parents.""\n\n""Worry about that later,"" says Salvucci. ""Right now we need to—""\n\nThe alarm wails through the halls.\n\nSalvucci turns to Meat. What’s left of the color in Meat’s face drains as he gazes at the control panel.\n\n""Contamination in sickbay. Quarantine square’s been broken.""\n\n""What’s going on?""\n\nSalvucci is quick. ""Neil, you stay here. We’ll lock you in so you’re protected. You two come with me. Arm yourselves.""\n\nMeat grabs his rifle, and the three of you are out of the cockpit. Right before the door slides shut, you hear Neil say ""protected from what?""\n\n1. [[Go to sickbay.]]"
"Take the shot anyway.","You squeeze the trigger. Neil's head swings right in front of the barrel when you do. His head pops. You scream as blood splashes across your face, but you continue firing until the clip goes dry.\n\nYou open your eyes. Neil's corpse is missing the top half of his skull. What was Markie lie absolutely still, the form riddled with holes.\n\n""Julia?"" Salvucci says through your walkie.\n\nYou pick up your walkie.\n\n1.[[""Neil and the creature are dead.""]]\n2.[[""I killed Neil and Markie.""]]\n"
"""He said Markie chased her into the hall.""","""Travis, you go check on Neil. Julia and I are going to look for Strauss.""\n\n""What should we do about them? They might, y’know, come back.""\n\n""Knock that horror movie shit off, Travis.""\n\n""Captain, with all due respect, I think we’re pretty well entrenched in horror movie territory right about now, oh with the crazy alien woman and dead crew members. Is it too much to humor me when I ask for a little reassurance?""\n\nSalvucci frowns. ""What are you suggesting?""\n\nMeat looks down at the corpses. ""I need oil. We can use the lab’s emergency coolant system to control the blaze.""\n\nSalvucci nods solemnly. ""Run to engineering. Grab what you need. Burn the bodies.""\n\n1.[[""You can’t be serious.""]]\n2.[[""Captain…""]]\n3. [[Let ‘em burn.]]\n\n"
"""Harsh, doc. Harsh.""","She looks at you coldly. ""I answered his question.""\n\nThe three of you say nothing for the rest of the walk.\n\nWhen you reach the sickbay, it’s deserted.\n\n""I suppose they're still out looking for it...or they’re dead.""\n\n""Jesus,"" Neil says, approaching the puddle of gore in the center of the room. He stands there, gazing down at it.\n \nYou lean against the wall and take a seat, but your pistol remains in your hand. \n\n""Meat and the captain aren’t really dead, are they?""\n\n1.[[""No, they're tough fuckers.""]]\n2.[[""Yeah, they're chum.""]]\n\n"
"""Julia,"" he says.","""Julia, everything okay? You’ve got that look in your eyes.""\n\nRyan constantly feels some need to ask if you’re all right. Either out of attraction or platonic concern, you’re not sure which. However, you are certain that it bugs the snot out of you.\n\n1.[[""Yes, I’m fine.""]]\n2.[[""Yes, Ryan, I’m fine.""]]\n3.[[""I’m fine.""]]\n"
"""Uh...yes, totally.""","She smiles at you through her helmet. ""You don't have a fucking clue do you? An earthworm is--what was that?""\n\nYou heard it too.\n\nMarkie slowly pulls out her pistol. ""Just in case.""\n\nSuddenly you hear a high-pitched whine from the darkness that sends a shiver down your spine. ""Guys, we're not alone,"" Markie says into her comm.\n\n""What's that?"" you hear Ryan say over your comm.\n\n""There's something in here with us.""\n\nHe nods at you and you both slowly back away. You pull out your pistol.\n\n""What is it?"" Meat asks.\n\n""No idea. Whatever it is, we're in its territory. I'm inclined to think we should leave it alone. Let's head back to the ship.""\n\nThe whine again. You focus your eyes and see something moving in the dark.\n\nMarkie sees it as well. ""There's too many of them. Fall back!""\n\nShe fires a single shot. The flash of light reveals that the creature isn't one thing,but many things, with feelers and sharp teeth.\n\nThey rush toward you, hundreds of them.\n\n1.[[Shoot the creatures.]]\n2.[[Retreat with Markie.]]\n\n"
"""You're not real.""","""No,"" she says, turning away from you. ""But it is.""\n\nYou turn just in time to make out the tentacle that rends your head from your body.\n\nThe last sound you hear is the beast grunting with satisfaction.\n\nThe End"
"""We're gonna blow him into space?""","""That's exactly what we're going to do. Hallway A has a section with a viewport enclosed by two doors. We get it there, you shoot the window, and then we close it in.""\n\n1. [[""This is ridiculously dangerous. Count me in.""]]"
"Shoot the beast.","You fire your last shot in the dark. The monster roars again and then you catch a glimpse of the monster’s hideous, reptilian face as it darts out and closes its jaws around Ryan’s head. \n\nLike fingers plucking a grape from a vine, the beast rips off your squadmate’s head, leaving a bloody and spewing stump behind. The squad vital monitor shrieks at you.\n\nYou flee.\n\nLooking over your shoulder, you watch as what’s left of Ryan is pulled out of sight.\n\nYou run and run and run. You lose feeling in your legs but somehow manage to keep going full speed anyway. Near the end, you swear that your heart is going to burst and that your lungs will catch on fire, but you manage to stumble out of the tunnel into the irradiated light of dusk.\n\nAcross the way, you can see Meat assisting a limping Markie. Behind them, you glimpse small purple mushroom shapes scuttling across the sand. You run toward your squadmates.  You’ve covered half the distance when, looking up, you see the Speedwell beginning its descent.\n\nWhen you reach them, Meat hands Markie off to you and turns to fires several rounds at the crab creatures. He tags all of them except for one. \n\nYou watch helplessly as the little bastard leaps through the air and, with tentacles shooting out from its underbelly, wraps itself around Markie’s arm.\n\nShe screams in pain. You whip out your empty pistol and bash the monster’s dome inward. The creature lets go of her arm and falls to the ground, legs squiggling. Its agony is short-lived, as Meat puts three rounds into the soft underbelly.\n\n""Fucking fuck."" He kicks the crab.\n\nYou turn to Markie, who’s holding her arm. \n\n1.[[""Is your suit ripped?""]]\n\n"
"""Why weren't we invited to the party?""","Meat nudges you. ""Not funny, Zoe.""\n\n""The infection spread,"" Strauss explains.\n\n""What fucking infection?"" Meat interjects.\n\nStrauss turns her cold gaze onto him. ""I don’t know precisely what is in her body, Travis. What I do know is that once I amputated her arm, it lunged at my throat.""\n\n""Bullshit.""\n\n""No, it’s…it’s…true,"" Ben stammers. ""It’s over there. Look.""\n\nHe’s right, of course. There, lying on the ground, is an arm with shriveled fingers caked in yellow ooze. You can barely make out three bullet holes.\n\n""Lenore says that Ben saved her life by putting it down,"" Salvucci explains.\n\n1.[[""What about Markie?""]]\n2.[[""Nice job, shrimp. Didn't think you had it in you.""]]"
"""How about we plan on not dying?""","""Come on. Let’s get this over with."" \n\nYou both retreat to the hanger.\n\n""Shit,"" he says as the door slides shut behind you. ""I thought this place was bigger.""\n\nHe’s right: it’s not much, and half the room is cramped by the reconnaissance droids.\n\n""Loosen the holding clamps on those. I’ll get our suits. Hurry, it can’t be far behind us.""\n\nYou deactivate the locks on the droids and catch the suit that Meat throws you. You’re just about to put the helmet on when you hear the clanging at the door.\n\n""It’s here. When it gets in front of the droids, shoot the hanger switch, okay? And for fuck’s sake, hold on to something.""\n\nThe door bursts open and flies across the hanger. In steps the monster, mouth stained with blood, eyes looking about wildly.\n\nIt takes a step toward you.\n\n""Over here, motherfucker!"" Meat shouts through his suit’s comm.\n\nIt growls and moves toward Meat. Its footsteps leave imprints in the steel floor.\n\nMeat backs away from the droids until his back is pressed against the wall. He grabs onto a wall-railing.\n\nThe monster steps in front of the line of droids.\n\n""Do it, do it now.""\n\nYou take aim at the switch on the far wall. You fire.\nThe shot slams into the switch, and the alarms blare. Meat slowly pulls himself along the rail until he’s behind the droids.\n\nThe hanger door opens and air swooshes out. You grip the railing beside you.\n\n""Hold on!""\n\nThe beast begins to backslide toward the hanger door, its feet dragging. It tries to throw a tentacle at Meat, but they’re pulled as well.  \n\nA moment later they snap off and go flying into the black.  Meat, clinging to the railing, kicks the droids. It takes a second for them to detach from their holders and tumble down into the behemoth. The first one knocks it back a couple of feet. The second droid seals the monster’s fate, knocking it off both of its feet and sending it careening into the stars.\n\n""Eat shit and die, you fuck!"" Meat screams through the comm. You can’t help but grin as the monster spins out of sight.\n\nThe alarms in the hanger continue to yell for a couple of seconds, and then the emergency seal protocol activates, and the hanger door slowly slides to a close again.\n\n""We did it,"" Meat says. ""We fucking did it.""\n\nHe walks over to you and hugs you tightly. You both laugh.\n\n""We’re alive!""\n\n1. [[""Home. Let's get the fuck home.""]]\n"
"""Of course. You too.""","He smiles. The cab pulls away and you walk past your box—you’ll get the mail later—and inside your home.\n\nThe door slides shut. And that’s when you fall apart. You crumble to the floor and bawl yourself to sleep. You wake hours later only to cry yourself asleep again.\n\nWhen you wake up again, you want to believe it’s a new day but you can still feel the weight of the dead on your shoulders. It’s a weight you never learn to completely shake, but you grow accustomed to it: the night terrors, the sudden flashes of Neil’s sacrifice.\n\nMeat’s friendship and an ungodly amount of therapy helps you get through the trauma, as does Jack, the man who becomes your husband. The military sticks you with an analyst position, something you’re quite fine with, though it is boring work.\n\nYou grow older. You and Jack talk about having kids.\n\n1. [[You have kids.]]\n2. [[You don't have kids.]]\n\n\n"
"""I get that vibe, too.""","""I tell you; I don't even think she qualifies as a human.""\n\nThe intercom clicks on before you can say anything. ""All officers report to sickbay,"" Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his bowl and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you’re out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nYou and Meat exchange no words on the way to sickbay. The door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube. She’s looking around wildly.\n\nYou smell gunsmoke. Ben has both of his hands wrapped around his pistol.\n\n1.[[""What happened?""]]\n\n\n"
"""Get out of the way!""","Before the words can leave your mouth, there’s a whooshing sound, followed by a giant spike tearing through Ryan’s chest, splattering the cave with red. Ryan’s pistol drops to the floor. He moans. \n\nYou cast your light on the protruding spike and realize, as your comrade is slowly being lifted in the air, that it’s a limb of some sort.\n\nMarkie’s voice barks over the comm. ""Zoe! What’s happening!? Ryan’s vitals are dropping."" You fire several shots into the darkness. One of them slaps into Ryan’s arm; his blue eyes gaze at you in shock.\n\nMeat now: ""Zoe? Answer us, girl. What the fuck is going on?""\n\n1.[[""We need to go. Now!""]]\n2.[[""Ryan's chum.""]]\n\n"
"""Strauss is removing her arm.""","Meat makes a face. ""Fucking nazi. It’s a tiny bite. Can’t they just disinfect it? It was bad enough losing somebody; we don’t have to maim her.""\n\n1.[[""It might be for the best.""]]\n2.[[""Yeah. It’s bullshit.""]]\n"
"Give Meat a chance to explain.","""He might come back, y’know?"" Meat says. ""Like a zombie.""\n\n""Stop talking,"" Salvucci says. ""We need to find Strauss.""\n\n""If she isn’t dead,"" Meat says grimly, eyes set on what’s left of Ben’s face.\n\n1.[[""He said Markie chased her into the hall.""]]\n2.[[""Ben said Markie chased her into the hallway. She’s probably dead.""]]"
"Don't say anything to him.","Neil nods at you one last time. You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nYou look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently.\n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. \n\n1. [[Put your hand on his shoulder.]]\n2. [[Don't.]]"
"""I wish.""","""You look better. Neil's already at the bar. Salvucci will be along soon.""\n\nSure enough, the little man is already getting his drink on when you step through the door.\n\n""Holyyyy shit,"" he says, the margarita he just sipped through his straw spraying everywhere. ""It's the bionic woman! Barkeep! I'm buying all this lady's drinks tonight.""\n\nYou take a seat next to him at the table. Meat sits next to you and nearly takes up your whole side of the booth.\n\nYou turn to Neil, who's bright red in the face.\n\n1.[[""What, no foam finger for me?""]]"
"End Strauss' pain.","You fire a single shot. Strauss' head goes back and her limbs go limp. Markie turns to see all of you. She growls and drops Strauss.\n\nThat's when Meat fires at the control panel. Upon impact, the door dividing the hanger from the rest of the ship comes down, seperating you from the hanger. Alarms blare. You watch from the door's window as both Strauss' corpse and the creature are sucked out into space. You watch the two forms drift away until they're dots, inseparable from distant stars.\n\nNone of you give a cheer or breathe a sigh of relief, however. There's a sense of shame that hangs over all of you, an awareness of your cowardice. You played it safe so that one of your crewmates could sacrafice herself.\n\nThe auto-close kicks in and the hanger door shuts itself. The alarms cease their cries.\n\n""We should go check Neil's console,"" Meat says.\n\nThe three of you silently make your way to the cockpit. Inside, you find the autopilot already engaged. The console is covered in blood; the pilot's corpse is behind it.\n\n""He knew he wasn't going to make it,"" Meat says bitterly. \n""Setting the autopilot must have been the last thing he did. Another goddamn hero.""\n\n""Everyone who died here will be honored when we get home,"" Salvucci says. \n\n""Oh good, because medals were really what I was concerned about,"" Meat says. ""I'm gonna go check the rest of the ship make sure nothing will snack on us while we sleep.""\n\n""I'll go with you,"" Salvucci says. ""Julia, go make sure the cryopods are ready.""\n\n1. [[Ready the cryopods.]]\n\n"
"""You can’t be serious.""","""I already took one risk today, Julia, and that got someone else killed. Superstitious or not, we’re doing this. Now come on.""\n\nSalvucci leaves the room. You turn to look at Meat. He’s pale.\n\n1.[[""Good luck.""]]\n2.[[""Be careful.""]]\n3.[[""You sick fuck.""]]\n"
"""No, I don't.""","""So you’re just as lonely and pathetic as I am. Well, misery, company and all that, I suppose.""\n\nThe two of you approach the cockpit. You knock on the door.\nNeil’s muffled voice comes from beyond the door: ""Password?""\n\n1.[[""Open the door, numbnuts.""]]\n2.[[""Oedipa.""]]"
"""Let's go kill it.""","Meat nods. ""Better than waiting around to die, I suppose.""\n\nSalvucci’s demeanor doesn’t shift. ""If we’re going to do this, we need to have a plan. How many guns do we have?""\n\nYou all lay your firearms on one of the tables: one assault rifle with two clips, three pistols with 18 rounds each. In total, you have 94 rounds. You also have a Molotov cocktail, courtesy of Meat.\n\n""Is that it?"" says Salvucci.\n\nMeat can’t hide his annoyance. ""What do you mean ‘is that it?’ We have enough here to kill that thing fifty times over. Sorry, captain,"" he adds quickly.\n\nSalvucci doesn’t bother acknowledging the insubordination. ""All right, tactics time. Everyone knows the layout of the ship, correct?""\n\n""Two main hallways. Left connects to crew quarters, common room, cafeteria, engineering, cryoroom, and bathrooms. The other leads to sickbay, cockpit, and the hanger,"" Strauss says quickly.\n\n""Pfft. Hanger, if you can call it that,"" Neil says. ""It’s barely big enough to fit our droids.""\n\n""Is that really appropriate right now?"" Strauss says.\n\n""I’m just sayin’.""\n\n""The big question, then, is how we’re dividing teams.""\n\n""I’m with Meat,"" Neil says quickly, eyeing the assault rifle.\nStrauss rolls her eyes.\n\n""What? I called dibs.""\n\n""Okay, so that puts Meat and Neil together. Zoe, you go with them too. Doctor Strauss and I will take the right hallway.""\n\n1. [[Follow Meat and Neil.]]"
"""I’m with Ryan.""","""In that case, I’m with Meat. Both groups will hike down the wall and take their respective tunnels. We’ve got the third one on the right,"" she says, pointing. ""You guys take the one over there.""\n\n1.[[""I’ve got a bad feeling about this.""]]\n2.[[""Roger that.""]]"
"Kill them both.","You take out the immiediate threat first, blowing Salvucci's mind out the back of his skull. The captain slumps.\n\nNeil puts his hand up to block the next round but the bullet tears through his palm and into his chest. He takes a step backward. You fire another shot. He falls back onto the console.\n\nGood child, the voice says. Now set a course for the human world.\n\nYou approach the console, pushing Neil's corpse out of the way. Neil was logged in, luckily. You play around with the settings until you find the autopilot and set a course for Mars.\n\nThe voice tells you it's proud of you and that great things await. It tells you to wait, so you do.\n\nLater on, your body seizes and you flop to the ground like a dying fish. You watch with a mixture of horror and fascination as your arm explodes, spraying blood, skin, and bits of bone everywhere, to reveal a purple jagged claw.\n\nNow, the voice says, your work truly begins. You follow its instructions and penetrate the chest cavities of Meat, Neil, and Salvucci with your claw. An hour later they've all risen. Of course, they're not really the people you knew. They're walking cocoons, dead flesh nuturing future soldiers.\n\nIt strikes you as odd that you should feel no guilt, but you chalk it up to how quickly you're evolving. Maybe guilt was, after all, a human weakness that needed to be culled. The closer you get to Mars, the more changes your body undergoes.\n\nFirst, another claw sprouts. Next, in your sleep, you lose your skin and find it replaced with a hard shell-like body. Your teeth fall from your mouth and are replaced with the kind of teeth monsters in fairy tales have.\n\nWhen you're a day away from the red planet, your soldiers hatch. They look like smaller versions of you.\n\nThey are to obey your every command, the voice says. Do not disappoint us, child.\n \nSoon you have forgotten your human life and have not only come to terms with what you are, but you look forward to your duties. The descendents of your new species will sing songs of your exploits and worship the very ground you have tread.\n\nMars looms and with it, your future.\n\n                      The End\n\n"
"""We need someone up in the vents.""","Meat raises an eyebrow. ""The ducts?""\n\nStrauss gets it. ""Of course. That’s how it could be traveling.""\n\n""Not good survival odds though, if someone finds her up there,"" Neil says, eyes toward the ducts. ""That close proximity? With bullets that don’t do shit? Yeah, I’m not gonna volunteer for that.""\n\n""Shit bird’s right,"" Meat says. ""If it is hiding up there, we need to figure out how to draw it out. If we go into the vent, we're fucking toast.""\n\n""What kind of insult is ‘shit bird?'"" Neil mutters.\n\n1.[[Draw the monster out.]]"
"""Dangerous. I like it.""","""In any other situation, your reaction would be troubling.""\n\nThe door behind you clangs.\n\n""Shit,"" Strauss says, coating the last bullet. ""At least we don't have to bait it now.\n\nA louder bang now. A tentacle penetrates the door.\n\n""Come on, let's go!""\n\nYou leave through the other sickbay door. In the hallway, she hands you your pistol. You find the viewport. It's a spacious square of glass that takes up half the wall. Behind you, there is the sound of giant, reveberating footsteps.\n\n""He's coming. You get near the switch. I'll jump back after you shoot the window."" Strauss positions herself near the window; you stand next to the switch. \n\nThe creature approaches. It growls as it lumbers toward the doctor. Both the monster and Strauss are close to the window now.\n\n1. [[Shoot the window.]]\n2. [[Shoot Strauss first.]]"
"Attack with your gun.","You grab the pistol from your holster. Too slow. Markie's atop of you, her semi-human hand wrapped around neck before you can even pull it up to chest level.\n\nYou aim upward and fire a shot into her chest. She looks down at you and smiles. The claw is surprisingly quick as it rips open your throat.\n\n""Zoe!"" Meat cries, but you know you're a goner. You watch helplessy as Salvucci and Meat both tackle her. Strauss is screaming about the cryopod. Your vision is becoming blurry. \n\nYou hope your crewmates make it out OK and that they have nice words to say about you at your funeral.\n\nMost of all, though, you wish you had gone for the goddamn saw. You were so close to getting out of here.\n\nThe End\n\n"
"""Explanation please.""","""This, right here, is preserved acid. Right now it's completely safe but once the tempature is high enough, it does what acid does.

"""Doc, put the gun down.""","""I had to kill him, you understand?"" she says. ""He attacked me.""\n\n""That's fine, doctor. He wasn't Ben anymore,"" Salvucci says.\n\n""Relax, doc,"" Meat adds, rifle aimed at her chest.\n\n""He bit me,"" she says, holding up her arm to show the bite mark. ""Shit, he bit me.""\n\nMeat narrows his eyes and holds the rifle steadily. No one says anything. Tears begin to stream down Strauss' face.\n\n""Maybe if I had more time I could come up with a cure or a way to fight the virus, but I can feel it in me now, coursing through my body. There's blood in the back of my throat. Vision blurry. Minutes. That's how long this takes to change us.""\n\nShe looks at the pistol, turns it over in her hand as though she's seeing something she's never seen before.\n\n""Kill it,"" she says. ""Don't let it reach Mars.""\n\nBefore any of you can stop her, she's pressed the barrel under her chin and pulled the trigger. Red splashes the ceiling. Strauss falls forward, head smashing into the floor.\n\n""Jesus fuck,"" Meat yells.\n\nWhatever color was left in Salvucci's face drains. Meat, in a moment of calculated rage, lifts his foot high over Ben's skull and stomps it several times. The innards of the boy's head ooze out like the insides of a old tomato. After he's done with Ben, he steps over to Strauss' body and aims his rifle down at her head.\n\nHe looks at the captain, who nods. He fires four shots and obliterates the top half of the woman's face.\n\n""Shit shit shit,"" he groans, stepping away from the mutilated corpse.\n\n1.[[""We should get to Neil.""]]\n"
"""I’m with Meat.""","""I'll go with Sergeant Can't Keep It In His Pants, then.""\n\n""Hey!""\n\n""We'll hike down the wall and take our respective tunnels.

"""This is kind of a shitty idea.""","""Everything will be fine,"" Markie says. You go your separate ways, hiking down the cliff with Ryan. It takes the larger portion of an hour to reach your tunnel. You step inside.\n\n""Flashlights,"" Ryan says. You tell the computer to turn on the light attachment in your suit. It flickers for a moment before shooting a cone of light from your chest compartment.\n\n""Let’s do this,"" he says, pulling out his pistol. You do the same.\n\nThe two of you proceed through the cave. On the Head Up Display (HUD) of your helmet you can see the heartbeat monitors of everyone in your squad. Yours is going a little faster than normal and, knowing that everyone else can see that, you feel a little embarrassed.\n\n""Ten bucks we find caveman drawings.""\n\n1.[[""Sure, Ryan.""]]"
"""Where the fuck did she go, Ben? Talk to me.""","""She chased the doctor into the hallway. Can’t believe Doctor Strauss left me here.""\n\nBefore you can say a word, something SLAMS into you, knocking you across the floor. You look up. Markie sits atop of Ben, a scalpel in her hand. You can only see the side of her face but you know that your friend is gone. Blood and grime are dripping off her body, and her skin is peeling.\n\nAs if to remove all trace of doubt the creature inside your friend speaks. ""Now now teacher’s pet, no one likes a suck-up!""\n\n""The hell?!"" Meat roars.\n\nThe thing slams the scalpel into Ben’s face, sinking the blade into his right eyeball.\n\n1. [[Rush her.]]\n2. [[Scream in terror.]]\n\n"
"""Take it easy on him.""","Strauss narrows her eyes at you. ""I shouldn't have to take it easy on him.

"Don't look at your foot.","He wheels you down to the cryo room where Neil and Salvucci are waiting.\n\n""There's captain kickass herself!"" the pilot says. ""Oh don't look so put out, I'll buy you a foam finger when we get back to Mars.""\n\n1. [[""Fuck. You.""]]\n2. [[Laugh.]]\n"
"Fire your pistol blindly.","Meat fires the rifle across the room, the gun’s light chasing Markie’s feet as she darts away. You raise your pistol and fire blindly in front of Meat’s light, hoping to hit her with a lucky shot. Beside you, Neil screams in terror.\n\nYou hear the tell-tell click of the rifle as the clip goes dry. Meat swings the rifle around to point the flashlight at the door.\n\n""Go!""\n\nYou all make a beeline for the door. Meat yanks on the handle and light bleeds into the darkness as you all sprint into the hallway. You slam the door and then bend over to catch your breath. Luckily, you manage to pull back just in time to avoid the spew of vomit that erupts from Neil’s mouth.\n\n""That was Markie—our Markie?"" he says, wiping the spittle from his lip.\n\n""Yeah, it was,"" Meat answers, a tinge of sadness in his voice.

"Look down","It’s Ben. There’s a giant slash across his cheek and his eyes are wide with fear, but he’s alive. You lean down to help him to his feet. You tug but he doesn’t get up.

The monster’s mouth is a vortex of meat and sharp teeth. Four tentacles protrude from its back, each one moving like a rattle snake.\n\n""No!"" you hear Strauss scream as one of the tentacles darts out and wraps itself around her neck.

"Move to comfort him","You put down the rifle and lean over to hug him and reassure him when something large SLAMS into you, knocking you and Meat's rifle across the floor. You look up. The rifle's light shines on Markie as she sits atop of Ben, a scalpel in her hand. You can only see the side of her face but you know that your friend is gone. Blood and grime are dripping off her body, and her skin is peeling.\n\nAs if to remove all trace of doubt the creature inside your friend speaks. ""Now now teacher’s pet, no one likes a suck-up!""\n\n""The hell?!"" Meat roars, whirling around. Too late.\n\nShe slams the scalpel into Ben’s face, sinking the blade into his right eyeball.\n\n1.

"""There are one, possibly two monsters crawling around the ship.""","""Wait, there's two of them now?""\n\n""If you must know,"" Strauss says, turning her head to glare at Neil, ""Ben saved me and I left him to die.

"""You too, okay?""","He smiles. The cab pulls away and you walk past your box—you’ll get the mail later—and inside your home.\n\nThe door slides shut. And that’s when you fall apart. You crumble to the floor and bawl yourself to sleep. You wake hours later only to cry yourself asleep again.\n\nWhen you wake up, you want to believe it’s a new day but you can still feel the weight of the dead on your shoulders. It’s a weight you never learn to completely shake, but you grow accustomed to it: the night terrors, the sudden flashes of the captain's dead eyes.\n\nMeat’s friendship and an ungodly amount of therapy helps you get through the trauma, as does Melissa, the lovely barista who becomes your wife. The military sticks you with an analyst position, something you’re quite fine with, though it is boring work.\n\nYou grow older. Melissa talks about having kids.\n\n1. [[Have kids.]]\n2.

She and Ben were a thing, so she’s on edge even more than usual, I guess.""\n\nThe two of you enter the cafeteria and then, after taking a precautionary look around, you go into the kitchen and stuff everything you can get your hands on into the two bags you brought from sickbay: fruit chips, soda, water bottles, pastries, canned soup.\n\nWhen you’ve filled the bags, you leave the cafeteria and make your way to the common room. Strauss, Neil, and Salvucci are waiting. The common room is a circular room with a couch, several chairs, and a large wall-mounted monitor connected a server archive of countless movies, shows, and documentaries.  \n\nOn the back wall, there are portholes—just like on the ships of old that sailed the waters—where you can gaze into the dark of space.\n\n""Run into any trouble?"" Salvucci asks as you hand him the bag.\n\n""Didn’t see a damn thing,"" Meat says.\n\n""I’m telling you,"" Strauss says, rubbing her bandaged arm, ""we won’t see it until it wants us to see it.""\n\nMeat grumbles something about paranoia and then heads over to the table, where Neil is setting up a checkers board.\n\n""How’s your arm, doctor?""

One day you see a report about Earth mysteriously self-destructing. ""An issue with the core,"" the handsome anchor says. \n\nNo one mentions monsters. No mentions nukes or fleets of war crusiers. The thought strikes you that no one will ever know the sacrifices of you or your crew. You weep and Jessica asks what's wrong.\n\nYou lie. Just as you do when she asks you about the augmentations--the very ones she installed. ""Accident in the cryotube,"" you tell her. You're so wracked with guilt over these lies that you make it a priority to never lie to her about anything else. For the most part, your relationship is one built on trust.\n\nThree years after your return to Mars you're married. It's a simple ceremony. Your parents show up, as do the surviving members of your crew. You eat cake. You kiss.\n\nYou move in with Jessica even though her apartment is smaller than yours. You just love the view of the Martian landscape, and Jessica, quite content not to move anything, is more than happy to oblige you.\n\nOne day you catch a glimpse of light reflecting off the glass of the balcony window. You step onto the balcony and look out across the red canyons of your planet just to take in the beauty of it all. This is your new life, you tell youself. You've earned every second of it.\n             \nThe End\n\n"
"Pair off with Markie.","""Awesome, someone I can actually depend on,"" she says, shooting a dirty look at Ryan.\n\n""The hell did I do?""\n\nShe ignores his question. ""You two will take that hole over there.""\n\n""All right then,"" Meat says.\n\n1.[[""Things that are not great ideas: this.""]]\n2.[[""Let's get on with this then.""]]"

The weapon's flashlight reveals there's nothing there.\n\n""Was that Mar--HOLY SHIT!""\n\nYou feel Neil scramble up your leg. You turn to see Markie, her face slowly melting on Neil's pants leg.\n\n""Oh shit oh shit oh shit.""\n\nNeil's head is in the way. You can't get a clear shot.\n\n1. [[Shoot anyway.]]\n2. [[Push Neil out of the way and lunge at Markie.]]"
"Sleep in the barracks.","In the barracks, Meat flips on the lights and the three of you find your respective beds.\n\n""Sleep tight, ladies,"" says Meat.\n\nTo your surprise, you find yourself drifting to sleep atop your bunk. Dreamless sleep covers your eyes. Briefly.\n\nYou awaken to the sound of choking. The first thing you see through blurred vision is a blood trail on the floor. You leap out of the bed and follow the trail out of the room to find Meat on the ground, neck slit. His eyes are watery as he grasps his throat.\n\n""Strauss,"" he chokes ""Strauss."" He nods toward the lounge.\n\nHe closes his eyes and is gone forever.\n\nYou go to the lounge. You open the door to find Strauss standing in the middle of the room, a bloody scalpel in her hand. Her back is to you.\n\n""Julia?"" she says, not turning to face you.\n\n1.[[""Lenore.""]]\n\n"
"Leave them to die.","It's a hard choice, but in the end, you get to your feet and sprint past the monster as it slaughters Strauss and Meat. You can hear their screams as you run down the hall. Soon things are mercifully silent. \n\nYou climb up into the ventilation and decide to make your base of operations there. You're a survivor, you tell yourself. All you have to do is stay alive two months. That's all.\n\nYou go, day by day, into the ship in search of supplies. You often go to the mess hall to stock up on food and bring it back to the vents. You run into the creature twice. Each time it's grown bigger, nastier. The first time, you get away without a scratch.\n\nThe second time, a tentacle pierces your ankle. You still manage to hop away, but you can't climb into the vent because of your injury. You seek refuge in the darkness of the barracks. Soon every breath brings pain. You refuse to accept the hand you've been dealt, even when Strauss, half her head missing, sits down beside you to have a chat.\n\n""You had a good run, idiot,"" she says. You stare at her ravaged face. \n\n1.[[""You're not fucking real.""]]"
"""Everybody chill the fuck out.""","""Believe me, Julia, I’m all for a drawn-out, rational conversation, but we can’t afford that luxury. She could expire and change at any moment.""\n\n""This is a bad horror movie,"" Ben moans, staring into the glass while Markie gazes at her own cauterized stump. She’s drooling now and has a nosebleed. You can see black veins popping beneath the skin on her forehead.\n\n""Enough,"" Salvucci says at last. ""We’re not killing anyone on my ship—we’re not savages.""\n\nMeat seems relived. ""Thanks boss.""\n\n""This is a mistake,"" Strauss says.\n\n""Maybe,"" he says, ""but it’s my mistake to make, not yours. Do what you can to keep her alive and prep her for cryo sleep.""\n\n""Again, a mistake.""\n\n""Doctor Strauss, unless you want to be brought before a military tribunal for insubordination, I suggest you do as I say.\n\n""Yes, captain,"" she says, voice calm, but there’s a fire in her eyes. ""Ben, lower the temperature to 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We’ll try to freeze her.""\n\nMarkie looks up at you all. A smile breaks out over her face and then she leans over and pukes.\n\n""Disgusting creature,"" Strauss mutters.\n\n""Travis, Julia, to the cockpit,"" Salvucci says.\n\n1. [[Go to the cockpit.]]\n"
"Find Neil.","You take the pistol from Meat's and proceed down the hall until you reach the cockpit. The door is unlocked.

"""You psychotic, pathetic piece of shit.""","""I didn’t have a choice,"" she stutters.\n\n""There’s always a choice,"" Meat barks, stomping toward her.\n\n""It’s what he wanted!""\n\n""We could have saved him!""\n\n""No, you coul—"" Her declaration dies in her throat as Meat violently wraps his hands around her neck. ""You’d do the same to any of us, wouldn’t you?""\n\n""Travis…stop,"" Neil says.\n\n""No, she’d kill us all if it worked to her advantage, Neil. I don’t want someone like that behind us.""\n\nStrauss' face is turning red.\n\n1.[[""Let her go.""]]\n2. [[Look into her eyes as she dies.]]\n"
"""You’re still angry about that time she reset your broken finger, you big baby.""","Well, yeah, a bit. Maybe,"" he says, glancing at his finger. ""It hurt.""\n\nThe intercom clicks on before you can say anything. ""All officers report to sickbay,"" Salvucci says.\n\nMeat gobbles up the rest of his bowl and grabs the rifle leaning upright against the table. You realize that you’re out of ammo, so you take one of the clips from your belt and reload the pistol.\n\nYou and Meat exchange no words on the way to sickbay. The door is open when you get there. Salvucci, Lenore, and Ben are standing around a bloody examination bed. You look to the right: Markie, one arm missing, is sequestered in a see-through quarantine cube. She’s looking around wildly.\n\nYou smell gunsmoke. Ben has both of his hands wrapped around his pistol.\n\n1.[[""What happened?""]]\n\n\n"
"""Does it matter?""","""No. I guess it really doesn't, does it?"" He turns away from them, though you notice his eyes lingering on Strauss' corpse for a moment.\n\n""God, I just want some sleep.""\n\n1.[[""Let's sleep then.""]]"
"Say nothing to him. Leave.","You make your way to the vent where Meat has just finished prying off the cover. The gas is thick in the air, making you slightly dizzy.\n\n""Tight fit,"" he says. ""I’ll go first so I can remove the next cover.""\n\nStrauss follows Meat. You look back to see that multiple tentacles have penetrated the door. Neil is pointing the pistol in the air and is breathing hard.\n\nYou force down the feeling of despair in your stomach and crawl through the vent. When you catch up to Strauss and Meat, he’s already kicking a cover.\n\n""Almost got it!"" With one last kick, the cover comes free. Meat grabs Strauss and pulls her through. You emerge into the hallway just in time to feel the ship shake violently. \n\nMeat slams his fist into the wall over and over. Strauss looks on sadly.\n\n1.[[""Hey! Focus. I need you here. We can stew in our guilt later, got that?""]]\n2. [[Leave him be.]]"
"""No idea.""","""Would it kill you to be at least a little dishonest?"" Meat says, smiling. ""Somebody's got to be the optimist.""\n\n""Make your move already, dude,"" says Neil, growing impatient.\n\n""Fine. Julia, we can talk strategy in a bit.""\n\nYou walk away.\n\n1. [[Talk to Salvucci and Strauss]]\n2. [[Go to sleep.]]\n\n"
"""We search the vents.""","Salvucci nods. ""That's a viable plan. We'll all enter the ventilation and hunt it down.""\n\n""All of us?"" Neil asks.\n\n""Yes, pilot. All of us.""\n\n""Do I get, like, a weapon at least?""\n\n""Here."" Meat says, shoving his own pistol into Neil's hands.\n\n""Bro, I've never used one of these.""\n\n""Well, if it makes you feel better, it wouldn't help much anyway. Bitch is a bullet sponge.""\n\n""Oh good, you know for a minute there I thought I might actually have decent odds of survival.""\n\n""Quit bickering,"" Salvucci says sternly. ""We'll go for the vent in the central hallway. From there we can spread out and cover the whole ship.""\n\nYou all make your way to the central vent, located in the belly of the ship. Salvucci pushes a button on the wall; the vent shrieks open and down pops a ladder.\n\n""I'll go north. Travis, you're with me. Julia and Neil, you go south. We meet back here in twenty minutes. If you spot it, call for help.""\n\nYou watch as Meat and Salvucci ascend the ladder. You and Neil wait a minute and then go up. \n\nThe shaft is tight, but both of you manage to fit, with you at the front. You crawl slowly, pistol in hand.\n\n""You know,"" Neil says after you've been crawling for five minutes, ""I never thought I'd go like this. I thought that it'd be from a heart attack...in a bathroom or something, nude on a tile floor, ass up in the air.""\n\n1.[[""Please be quiet.""]]\n2.[[""Do tell.""]]\n"
"""Don’t thank me.""","""I guess I shouldn’t expect kindness from any of you, though I only did what had to be done.""\n\nMeat lights the rag and then tosses the bottle at the corpses.
